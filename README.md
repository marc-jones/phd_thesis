## Introduction
    BBCH
    Winter and Spring
    RNA-Seq

## Flowering time control and evolution in a spring variety

    Developmental transcriptome design and quality control of the RNA-Seq data
        ~~Justifying experimental design decisions~~
        Darmor reference sequence and gene model comparisons
        Percentage of mapped reads
        Effect of running leaf and apex samples separately
        Effect of resequencing samples

    General trends
        Copy number effects
        Gene ontology term enrichment
        Protein domain enrichment
        Differential expression between time points

    Flowering time genes
        General patterns for all flowering time genes
        TFL1
        FD
        FT
        LFY
        AP1
        SOC1

    Divergence beyond expression
        FD
            Dimerization
            Modelling
        TFL1
            Promoter analysis

    Discussion
        Apex dissection means that in some cases repressors and their targets are 'expressed' together
        Lighting during the cold likely kept Westar vegetative.

## Comparisons to a winter variety

    General trends
        Correlation based analysis
        Differences in gene copy number expression
        Gene ontology term enrichment
        Protein domain enrichment
        Differential expression between time points

    Gene expression correlation networks

    The response to cold
        Circadean rhythm
        Vernalization pathway
            FLC
            VIN3

    Data dissemination
