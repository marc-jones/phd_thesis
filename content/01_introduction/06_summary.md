This thesis will investigate the divergence of gene copies in *B.\ napus* on a genome-wide scale, with a particular focus on the flowering time genes.
This was accomplished by generating a transcriptomic time series collected before, during and after the floral transition.

The first chapter explains how the data was collected and motivates the experimental design decisions taken.
Using only data from a spring *B.\ napus* variety, I reveal that flowering time genes have been preferentially retained in the *B.\ napus* genome.
Widespread divergence in the pattern of regulation between copies of homologous genes suggests that this could have contributed to the observed retention.
An in-depth assessment of regulatory divergences between key floral integrators is conducted.
The chapter concludes with two case studies investigating sequence divergence for *B.\ napus* homologues of *TFL1* and *FD*.
In the case of *TFL1*, the sequence divergence correlates with regulatory divergence, whereas the sequence divergence in *FD* potentially influences the molecular function of the gene.

The second chapter focusses on a winter variety of *B.\ napus*.
The effects of a vernalization requirement on the global transcriptional landscape are studied by assessing the extent of variety specific expression.
Regulatory divergence in the genes involved in the vernalization pathway are assessed and compared to the expression of the same genes in the spring variety.
The comparison between a spring and winter variety allows the vernalization response to be assessed for each copy.
Finally, the effects of a cold requirement for flowering on the expression of floral integrators are studied to determine if certain copies are more vernalization sensitive than others.

The final chapter details a web resource, created to allow the dataset collected to be interrogated in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.
The dataset can be searched using Arabidopsis gene names to identify *B.\ napus* homologues and displays the expression patterns of these homologues in both varieties and in both tissues sampled.
Alternatively, *B.\ napus* genes can be searched using sequence homology.
Although flowering time genes are the focus of this thesis, the approach taken in the first two chapters to assess regulatory divergence can be carried out using any gene family.
The creation of this website allows researchers to study their own genes of interest without the need to download large datasets or carry out laborious read alignment.
