Forecasting future events has been something humans have tried to do for millennia.
Cicero in *De Divinatione* discusses the use of animal entrails, bird flight, and movements of celestial objects, to forecast the outcome of battles, trade deals, and crop growth (Cicero, *De Divinatione* 1.10, 1.1).
A story recounted by Cicero, and also by Aristotle (Aristotle, *Politics* 1.1259a), tells the tale of Thales of Miletus, a philosopher who used astrology to predict the olive harvest for the following year.
Knowing that oil presses would be in great demand during that time, Thales proceeded to rent oil presses months in advance at reduced rates.
When the predicted olive harvest came Thales had access to every available press, and was able to profit from his forecast by subletting the presses at high rates.
Most modern farmers would likely respond to crop predictions based on the movements of moons and stars with a couple of choice words.
The story of Thales' olive presses, however, illustrates how useful crop predictions can be, regardless of where the forecast comes from.
Knowing the best varieties to plant and the growth behaviour of crops allows for improved crop management.

Modern methods of predicting crop yields have progressed beyond the study of entrails[@di_paola_overview_2016].
However, the genetic links between the model inputs (satellite imagery, meteorological data, a cow's liver) and the outputs (predictions of crop yield) are often lacking.
Although crop simulation models can be very sophisticated, detail at the genetic level is either not included, or is included empirically[@whisler_crop_1986].
A pragmatic stance may be that if the predictions from such methods are accurate, then who cares?
What this viewpoint ignores is that understanding the underlying mechanisms of how climate and the environment affects crop growth can allow for novel crop varieties to be engineered, either through directed breeding or genetic modification[@jung_flowering_2009].
These varieties could be engineered to suit particular growing seasons or locations.

Despite how potentially useful they could be, mechanistic models of plant growth have received most research effort within model plant species.
It is my goal, in this thesis, to approach the problem of how to adapt models of flowering time for the model plant species *Arabidopsis thaliana* to the crop species *Brassica napus*.
