## Introduction {#section:spring_introduction}

The transition from vegetative to floral growth is a vitally important developmental transition in the life of an angiosperm plant.
One of the aspects of the transition under strict regulation is the timing of the transition.
The life strategy of a plant will determine when during the year the plant will flower.
Flowering at a point in the year that does not suit the life strategy of a plant potentially will result in the plant not producing viable seed or producing less seed.
One consideration are the weather conditions during which the seeds develop.
Although this impacts plants growing in natural environments, this is also important in crop species grown for their seed, where the weather during the seed filling period can potentially affect the quality and quantity of seeds produced.
Other considerations are the availability of suitable pollinators.
In plants grown in natural conditions, having heterogeneous flowering times likely confers an advantage at the population level.
However, in an agronomic setting having a heterogeneous flowering time makes the maintenance of the crop more difficult.
For example, pollen beetles are simultaneously a pollinator and a pest of *Brassica napus*.
When the flowers are in the bud stage they are susceptible to damage from the beetles, but later in development the beetles act as pollinators to the plant[@williams_feeding_1978].
Application of pesticides to control pollen beetles are therefore complicated if plants are at different stages of the floral transition.
Understanding what influences the flowering time of plants will therefore allow for improvements to be made to crop species where homogeneous flowering times are preferred.

In order to adequately time the transition to flowering, angiosperms have evolved to perceive their environment and integrate the information into a suitable flowering response.
The regulatory networks that underlie the sensing and integration of environmental cues to produce a flowering response have been most thoroughly studied in the model species *Arabidopsis thaliana* (hereafter Arabidopsis).
Decades of work have uncovered a number of flowering time pathways that converge on a central network of floral integrators.
The main flowering time pathways are the autonomous pathway, the photoperiod pathway, the vernalization pathway, and the ageing pathway.
The autonomous pathway acts as 

Expression analysis done before and after shifting Arabidopsis plants from short day to long day growth were able to distinguish the order of activation for a number of floral determination genes[@schmid_dissection_2003].

Gene multiplication events lead to a number of consequences for the evolution of gene regulatory networks.
In whole genome multiplication events, all the genes in a regulatory network are simultaneously present as multiple copies.
Importantly, the additional gene copies have the same regulatory sequences. This leads to a huge increase in the number of regulatory interactions expected.

This chapter will introduce the developmental time series dataset we have developed and the quality control checks performed on it.
General trends from the data will be discussed that illustrate the regulatory divergence that occurs following gene multiplication events, as well as highlighting the behaviour of groups of genes.
The information from the developmental time series will be used to investigate how expression of the *Brassica napus* homologues of key floral integrators have diverged from one another, and compare their expression patterns to the Arabidopsis orthologues.
Finally, some of the *Brassica napus* flowering time genes are compared to reveal divergence at the sequence level that supplements the information from the developmental time series.
