## Developmental transcriptome design and quality control {#section:spring_developmental_transcriptome}

To assess regulatory divergence at the level of the whole genome we wished to construct a developmental transcriptome for *Brassica napus*.
A key goal of generating such a dataset was to allow the flowering control mechanisms to be followed and dissected.
We decided that a developmental transcriptome that captured the global shift in expression during the floral transition would allow for such regulatory mechanisms to be investigated.
Additionally, a key difference in the *Brassica napus* varieties commercially grown in Europe and Canada is their requirement for a vernalization period.
We therefore wished to focus on elucidating the effect the vernalization pathway had on flowering, and potentially the effect a requirement for cold has had on the evolution of gene function.
To this end, a developmental transcriptome for both a spring and winter variety was studied.
A key challenge resulting from the decision to compare winter and spring varieties is synchronizing the development of these varieties and taking developmentally comparable samples.
Once the samples were collected, a number of downstream decisions were made regarding the computational methods necessary to quantify the level of expression genome wide.

Here I discuss how the samples were collected, justifications for the experimental design, and the downstream quantification and quality control steps.

### Experimental design and sample collection {#section:spring_experimental_design}

Investigating the control mechanisms for flowering was the main motivation for this experiment, and this drove many of the key decisions during the design.
As discussed in subsection TODO, genes involved with flowering are expressed in many tissues throughout the plant.
This is in part due to the coordination of flowering with the environment requiring inputs from many plant structures, and partly a result of some flowering genes having pleiotropic effects throughout the plant.
In order to capture the expression dynamics of as many flowering genes as possible, it was decided to sample leaf and apex tissues across development.
There is evidence for the vernalization, aging, autonomous, and ambient temperature pathways having genes expressed in both of these tissue types.
Additionally, due to the role leaves play in light capture and plant primary metabolism, samples from that tissue allow for the circadean clock and photoperiod pathways to be studied.
Floral integrators are genes expressed in the shoot apical meristem and integrate signals from the various flowering time pathways into a robust and coherent response.

Seeds from both varieties were sown and the plants grown under long day conditions with controlled temperatures of 18 &deg;C during the day and 15 &deg;C at night.
