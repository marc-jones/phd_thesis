## Discussion

Whole genome triplication and interspecific hybridization have resulted 

Duplicate gene pais show extensive divergence in DNase 1 regulatory footprints. Vast majority of paralogous pairs are either partly of fully diverged in their regulatory elements.[@arsovski_evolution_2015]

Review of regulatory rewiring following gene multiplication events. first, we discussed how the gene dosage balance
hypothesis can result in preferential rewiring of certain
biological pathways; secondly, how the extension of the
regulatory repertoire can result in spatiotemporal expres-
sion divergence; thirdly, how the preserved modularity
after polyploidization can result in functional differen-
tiation at the module level. Combined with the second
point this can potentially give rise to homeologous modules
that have diverged in their spatiotemporal expression; and
finally, how WGD increases the potential for redundancy
by providing buffering partners for a large number of genes. [@de_smet_redundancy_2012]

expression divergence specifically indicative of subfunctionalization and / or neofunctionalization contributes to the maintenance of most if not all duplicated regulatory genes in Arabidopsis. 85% of regulatory genes analyses have undergone. didn't find a relationship between the ratio of nonsynonomous to synonomous mutations and expression divergence. evolution of regulatory proteins in Arabidopsis is significantly impacted by regulatory subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization after duplication. duarte_expression_2006

duplication-degeneration-complementation. degenerative mutations facilitate, rather than hinder, the preservation of duplicate functional genes.
probability
of duplicate-gene preservation increases with the num-
ber of regulatory regions and with the mutation rate per
regulatory region
under the DDC model, most duplicate genes that are
destined to be preserved by subfunctionalization are
expected to become so within a few million years.
which assumes that drift and purifying selection is usu-
ally sufficient for the fixation of subfunctional alleles.
predicts that the probability of gene retention is greater for genes with more subfunctions.
suggests that regulatory divergence is a more common form of gene retention relative to the acquisition of novel functions. force_preservation_1999
