*Brassica napus* (oilseed rape) is an economically important crop species that exhibits considerable varietal differences in flowering behaviour.
Efforts to translate knowledge of flowering time control from model species to *B.\ napus* are complicated by the evolutionary history of the crop.
Multiple whole genome duplication events have resulted in multiple copies of flowering time control genes being present in the *B.\ napus* genome.
Understanding how these copies have diverged would allow for directed breeding of varieties with flowering times optimized for particular growth locations or periods.

The aim of this thesis was to understand the extent of divergence among duplicated flowering time genes in the *B.\ napus* genome.
A transcriptomic time series was collected and used to investigate gene expression during the floral transition.
Copies of floral genes were found to be retained in the *B.\ napus* genome, in line with expectations from the gene dosage hypothesis.
Extensive expression differences between these retained genes indicated that subfunctionalization may also play a role in the observed retention.
The diverged expression profiles between *B.\ napus* homologues of an Arabidopsis floral integrator, *TFL1*, correlated with sequence differences in regulatory elements, highlighting the importance of cis-regulatory elements in the evolution of gene function.
Sequence differences between *BnFD* genes were found to alter the predicted dimerization affinities of the proteins.

A requirement for cold in order to flower (vernalization) is an important agronomic trait in oilseed crops.
The vernalization pathway was investigated by comparing the transcriptomes from both a spring and a winter variety of *B.\ napus*.
Two *BnFLC* genes, *BnFLC.A2* and *BnFLC.A10*, emerged as likely gene candidates for mediating this response in the winter variety.
Differences in the leaf transcriptome, and in the expression of *BnFLC* genes, between varieties suggest the vernalization pathway is acting in both the leaf and apex.
