Many thanks to my supervisors, Richard Morris and Judith Irwin, for their support and reassurance throughout my PhD.
Richard and I have a worryingly similar sense of humour and it has been reassuring to see that self-deprecation, making awful jokes and forcing tenuous puns do not preclude a career in science, as these are all traits we share.
Thank you for introducing me to opera and Fivefingers.
Judith's passion for science, but also the way she values her time away from work, has set a fantastic example that I hope to follow for the rest of my career.
Her patience, particularly when it comes to myself and qPCR is admirable.
I really appreciate the freedom both have given me to explore aspects of this project as I desired, and their constructive inputs and insights on the work throughout my PhD.
Working with them, and in their groups, has been a truly enjoyable four years and I couldn't have asked for a better PhD experience.
Thanks also to both for comments on this thesis, and my apologies for any worries leading up to the deadline!

Elsewhere at the John Innes Centre, I thank the members, and ex-members, of Richard's group.
Many thanks to Vinod Kumar for being on my supervisory team and for interesting discussions and comments throughout my PhD.
Thank you to Matthew Hartley and Tjelvar Olsson for informative conversations on computational science and ways to improve my coding.
Julie Ellwood's attitude and general approach to life is brilliant, and I feel honoured to have witnessed it first hand.

The Brassica tendency group has grown over the years of my PhD, but my thanks go to the core members who have been there since the beginning: Richard Morris, Judith Irwin, Rachel Wells, Martin Trick, Nick Pullen, Emily Hawkes, and Eleri Tudor.
It's hard to imagine the early days of these meetings when we were almost speaking different languages, but doesn't that go to show how far we've all come?
The social occasions we've shared have always been really enjoyable; there aren't many students who can say they've played Rock Band with their PhD supervisor!
Thank you in particular to Nick Pullen, who in many ways, feels like an additional supervisor.
The drive Nick has for science and his motivation has been inspiring, and I thank him for his continued guidance on aspects of this project and for his friendship.

My thanks go to my peers on the Rotation PhD programme, those that run it, and those labs that I rotated in.
Thanks to Sarah O'Connor for letting me join her lab and to Richard Payne for the unenviable task of having to teach a computational biologist his way around said lab.
Many thanks to Caroline Dean for my time in her lab and to Susan Duncan for supervising me.
Thank you for the fantastic trip to Sweden, and to both Caroline and Susan for discussions about vernalization that have worked their way into this thesis.
Nick Brewin, and later, Steph Bornemann both ran the Rotation PhD programme exceedingly well and the Rotation retreats were always a highlight of the year.
Many thanks to the Rotation students from my year, Andrew Maclean, Nuno Leitão, Jemima Brinton, and Jie Li, for many social occasions and being great friends.

The cohort of PhD students with whom I've spent my time at the John Innes Centre have been fantastic.
Thank you for Friday nights at the Rec, house parties, and a lot of fun.
In particular, thanks to Andrew Maclean, Nuno Leitão, and Bethan Edmunds for three years of cohabitation in the Marble Factory; may the strange inside jokes and quote wall live on forever.
Thank you also to Daisy Orme and Natasha Senior for an enjoyable final year of student house life.
I am exceeding grateful to Rachel Prior both for making me realise the benefits of organized fun and for help getting this thesis bound.
Many thanks to the Board Game Group of Chris Judge, Peter Emmrich, Matt Evans, Alex Calderwood, Thom Booth, and Ben Hales.
You've helped foster and nourish an addiction that I hope to have for the rest of my life.
I'm very lucky to have met Jemima Brinton during my PhD, whom I thank for being there when I need someone, picking me up when I'm down, and for having a great attitude towards life.

Finally, I am indebted to my family for the love and support they give me on a daily basis.
It gives me tremendous strength and perseverance, and I will always be grateful.
These thanks extend to family members who are no longer with us, but who are never too far from my thoughts.
