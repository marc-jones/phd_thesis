## Floral integrator expression divergence in a winter variety {#section:winter:floralintegrators}

A potential avenue for the production of *B.\ napus* varieties with altered flowering time is via changes to the regulation of floral integrators.
This is evidenced by studies that characterised the phenotypes of Arabidopsis plants constituently expressing floral genes, with plants frequently exhibiting alterations to flowering time and flower morphology[@mandel_gene_1995; @kardailsky_activation_1999; @samach_distinct_2000; @lee_agamous_like_2000; @weigel_developmental_1995; @kobayashi_pair_1999; @teper_bamnolker_flowering_2005].
This is supported by findings in Arabidopsis where natural variation at the *CO* promoter impacts flowering time[@rosas_variation_2014], while variation at the *FT* orthologue in perennial ryegrass has also been found to be associated with flowering time differences[@skot_allelic_2011].
Therefore, different alleles or altered regulation of floral integrators could potentially be contributing to the delay in flowering observed in the winter variety.

The altered expression of particular floral integrators could be due to an increased sensitivity to the vernalization response.
In their analysis of gene expression divergence in Arabidopsis, Blanc and Wolfe (2004) discussed the concerted divergence of gene expression[@blanc_functional_2004].
Concerted divergence involves the parallel divergence of duplicated genes that are in the same interaction network, resulting in two versions of the network expressed in a spatiotemporally distinct manner.
A potential scenario in such a situation is that each network becomes specialized towards a particular role.
This could occur when multiple signalling pathways are integrated by the network, with the diverged networks becoming specialized towards particular inputs.
In the case of the regulatory network underlying flowering, duplication and subsequent loss or modification of cis-regulatory elements[@arsovski_evolution_2015; @teichmann_gene_2004; @tsai_evolution_2012] could result in certain copies of the floral integrators becoming more sensitive to particular inputs, such as the photoperiod, vernalization, or ageing pathways.
This is particularly interesting given the regulatory divergence observed in the *BnFLC* genes in Tapidor (section \ref{section:winter:vern}), as different homologues of floral integrators may be influenced by different *BnFLC* homologues.

To determine if any of the duplicated floral integrators in *B.\ napus* have diverged to become more sensitive to the vernalization response, the expression of these genes was compared between Westar and Tapidor.
The greatest difference was observed for *BnFT* and *BnTFL1* gene expression, with the expression of *BnFT* being consistent with *BnFLC* mediated repression as observed in Arabidopsis[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @searle_transcription_2006].
The regulation of *BnAP1* and *BnFD* homologues are also altered in the winter variety.
As observed at the global level, the vernalization requirement seems to delay the upregulation of many of the floral integrators.
However, despite differences in timing, the expression behaviours of the majority of floral integrators in the winter variety are in agreement with the spring variety, suggesting that these genes are not responsible for the flowering time differences observed between the varieties.
The differences identified, however, provide potential future avenues for dissecting the flowering response in *B.\ napus*.

### A vernalization requirement delays the upregulation of floral integrators during the floral transition {#section:winter:floraldelay}

At the global level, vernalization delayed the increase in expression of genes involved with flower development in the apex (section \ref{section:winter:som}).
As many of the floral integrators increased in expression during the floral transition (section \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators}), the expression of these genes was investigated to determine if vernalization delays their upregulation also.
For the *BnFT* and *BnAP1* genes, a post-cold increase is seen in the first time point sampled after the vernalization treatment in the spring variety (Figures \ref{figure:223:ftleaf} and \ref{figure:226:ap1apex}), whereas the increase in the winter variety is only seen at the final time point (Figures \ref{figure:3xx:ftleaf} and \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}).
Likewise, *BnLFY* and *BnSOC1* genes peak in expression at the day 69 time point in spring (Figures \ref{figure:231:lfyapex}, \ref{figure:227:soc1apex}, and \ref{figure:228:soc1leaf}) and the day 83 time point in winter (Figures \ref{figure:3xx:lfyapex}, \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex} and \ref{figure:3xx:soc1leaf}).
Finally, the *BnFD* genes peak at day 67 in the spring (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:fdleafapex}) and day 72 in the winter variety (Figure \ref{figure:230:fdapex}).
The later upregulation of floral integrators in the winter variety during the time series relative to the spring variety is consistent with the vernalization response acting to repress the floral transition.

### Between variety regulatory divergence in all *BnFT* and *BnTFL1* genes and select homologues of *BnFD* and *BnAP1* {#section:winter:floraldifferences}

method (discussed in section \ref{section:spring:somexplanation})

profiles.}\label{figure:3xx:ftleaf}
\end{figure}

One of the ways that *FLC* acts as a floral repressor is through the repression of *FT* expression in the leaf[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @searle_transcription_2006].
To investigate how *BnFT* genes were affected by a requirement for cold, their expression was investigated.
In the Westar leaf, four *BnFT* copies are expressed, exhibiting high expression before and after the cold treatment (Figure \ref{section:spring:ft}).
In contrast in the winter variety, the *BnFT.A2* and *BnFT.C2.Random* copy are not expressed above 2.0 FPKM at any point during the time series.
In terms of the expression traces, *BnFT.A7* and *BnFT.C6* in the spring variety decrease in expression during the cold treatment, returning to pre-cold expression levels at the first time point after the cold treatment.
In the winter variety, however, the expression of *BnFT.A7* and *BnFT.C6* is low initially and remains low until the final time point, at which point the genes increase in expression.
The high level of *BnFT* expression before cold in the spring variety, correlates with low level of many *BnFLC* copies (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:flcleafcgenome}).
Likewise, the low levels of *BnFT* before cold correlate with high levels of *BnFLC* in the winter variety.
These observations are consistent with certain *BnFLC* copies maintaining their repressive effect on *BnFT* expression.

In terms of the magnitude of expression, the maximal expression level of the A7 and C6 copies of *BnFT* are six- to eight-fold lower in the winter variety, while the A2 and C2 copies are not observed above the 2.0\ FPKM expression threshold.
This could suggest that the requirement for cold maintains the expression of these genes at a lower level.
However, it should also be noted that the lower expression in the winter variety may also result from the effect of leaf senescence impacting the expression.
This is supported by the correlation analysis, that suggested the developmental stage of the plant influenced the first true leaf to a lesser extent than the apex (section \ref{section:winter:correlation}).
Regardless, that the A2 and C2 copies are not observed above 2.0\ FPKM is particularly striking given that *BnFT.A2* is the copy with the highest maximal expression level in Westar.
In addition, while the spring variety had low, but detectable, expression of *BnFT.A7* and *BnFT.C6* in the apex, no such expression is observed in the winter variety.
Taken together, this suggests that the vernalization response has a greater effect on the expression of the A2 and C2 copies of *BnFT* than on the A7 and C6 copies, although lower expression is observed for all copies in both tissues in the winter variety.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics{figuredirectory/exp_tfl1_apex.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Expression traces for the \emph{BnTFL1} genes in the
apex of Tapidor.}}{The expression values and the 95\% confidence
intervals of those expression values as computed by Cufflinks are
displayed. A heatmap of the clustering coefficients calculated by the
SOM based method (discussed in section
\ref{section:spring:somexplanation}) quantifies the similarity between
the expression profiles, which in this case demonstrates that the two
regulatory profiles have diverged.}\label{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}
\end{figure}

Although *TFL1* and *FT* are very highly related structurally[@ahn_divergent_2006; @hanzawa_single_2005; @ho_structural_2014] their regulation is quite distinct.
For example, the vernalization flowering pathway has not been found to influence the expression of *TFL1*, whereas it has for *FT*[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @searle_transcription_2006].
Despite this, copies of *BnTFL1* display large differences in regulation between the two varieties (Figures \ref{figure:232:tfl1apex} and \ref{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}).
Comparing regulatory patterns, *BnTFL1.C3* displays a somewhat similar expression trace in the two varieties, in that a cold-induced increase and a post-cold increase in expression is observed.
However, the post-cold peak in expression occurs earlier in the winter variety at the day 67 time point, as opposed to day 69 in the spring variety.
In section \ref{section:spring:tfl1} I discuss the decrease in expression of *BnTFL1.C3* at the final time point in light of the expression of *BnLFY* and *BnAP1*, suggesting that the increase in expression of these genes results in the observed decrease in *BnTFL1.C3* expression.
However, for this to be the case the expression of *BnLFY* and *BnAP1* genes in the winter variety would have to increase in expression earlier in the time series, rather than later as observed (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:lfyapex} and \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}).
Another potential explanation for the earlier peak in expression may be a result of the day 69 samples from Tapidor not being included in the sequencing.
Therefore, the expression of *BnTFL1.C3* may in fact be very similar in both varieties, with the different timings of the floral transition between the two varieties having little effect on the expression of the gene.
Performing qPCR on the full set of samples taken from Tapidor, as was done in Westar (Figure \ref{figure:233:tfl1conservation}), would allow for this to be tested.
The expression magnitude of the other *BnTFL1* copies is reduced in the winter variety relative to the spring variety, with *BnTFL1.Cnn.Random* being the only other copy expressed above 2.0 FPKM at at least one time point.
In addition to being lowly expressed, *BnTFL1.Cnn.Random* lacks the peak in expression during the cold treatment in the winter compared to the spring variety.
The cold response therefore reduces the expression of all copies of *BnTFL1*, and also influences the timing of regulatory changes.
However, the regulatory divergence observed between the homologues is present in both varieties.

In addition to *FT*, *SOC1* is another floral integrator directly regulated by *FLC*[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @hepworth_antagonistic_2002; @searle_transcription_2006].
As already discussed (section \ref{section:winter:floraldelay}) the upregulation of *BnSOC1* genes post-cold treatment is delayed in the winter variety.
However, an additional manner in which the *BnSOC1* genes have diverged between varieties is the expression magnitude.
In both the apex (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}) and the leaf (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:soc1leaf}), the maximal expression levels of the *BnSOC1* genes are two- to four-fold lower in the winter variety than in the spring.
This suggests that the vernalization requirement results in suppression of *BnSOC1* expression for all copies, while the general pattern of expression (whether the copy is expressed during cold, or increases after cold, or both) is maintained.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics{figuredirectory/apex_leaf_fd.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Expression traces for the \emph{BnFD} genes in

heatmap of the clustering coefficients calculated by the SOM based
method (discussed in section \ref{section:spring:somexplanation})
quantifies the similarity between the expression profiles. Regulatory
divergence between some copies is observed early in the time series,
although all copies increase in expression after the vernalization
treatment.}\label{figure:3xx:fdleafapex}
\end{figure}

As both *BnFT* and *BnTFL1* genes exhibit altered expression in the winter variety, the expression of *BnFD* copies was investigated as the product of the *FD* gene interacts with both FT and TFL1 in Arabidopsis[@jaeger_interlocking_2013; @abe_fd_2005; @wigge_integration_2005].
Within the apex, five of the six *BnFD* copies display similar expression patterns between Tapidor and Westar.
However, the A1 copy shows markedly different regulation in the winter variety relative to the spring (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:fdleafapex}).
*BnFD.A1* exhibits an expression pattern similar to the A8 and C7 copies, resulting in the three genes sharing a regulatory module.
This is in stark contrast to the spring variety, where the A1 copy has a regulatory pattern completely distinct from the other copies (Figure \ref{figure:230:fdapex}).
This change causes the *BnFD* genes in Tapidor to have a *gradated* pattern of regulatory module assignment, whereas in Westar they exhibited a *distinct* pattern.
The magnitude of expression is also different, with *BnFD.A1* achieving the highest maximal expression value of all the other copies in Tapidor apex samples, whereas in Westar *BnFD.A1* was one of the most lowly expressed copies.
In addition, whereas no *BnFD* copy was expressed above the 2.0 FPKM threshold in the leaf in Westar, the *BnFD.A1* copy was expressed in the leaf in Tapidor.
All of these observations suggest that the *BnFD.A1* has a different function in the winter variety as opposed to the spring variety.

Finally, another notable difference observed between varieties was the expression of the *BnAP1* copy on A2.
The *BnAP1* genes in the spring variety were divided into three regulatory modules; one displaying an increase post-cold, one showing a transient increase during vernalization, and one displaying partial behaviour of both (Figure \ref{figure:226:ap1apex}).
*BnAP1.A2.Random* was uniquely assigned to the latter module in the spring variety.
In the winter variety, the post-vernalization increase of *BnAP1.A2.Random* is exaggerated, with the magnitude of expression at the end of the time series being similar to the *BnAP1.C6a* copy.
The transient increase during the vernalization period is still observed in the A2 copy in the winter variety.
However, as a result of the increase during vernalization being relatively slight in comparison to the increase at the final time point, the gene is assigned to the same regulatory module as the A7 and C6 copies.
The *BnAP1.A2.Random* gene in Tapidor, therefore, behaves more similarly to the A7 and C6 copies and to *AP1* in Arabidopsis, than it does in the spring variety.

### Similarities in floral integrator regulation between varieties {#section:winter:floralsimilarities}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics{figuredirectory/exp_ap1_apex.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Expression traces for the \emph{BnAP1} genes in the
apex of Tapidor.}}{The expression values and the 95\% confidence
intervals of those expression values as computed by Cufflinks are

SOM based method (discussed in section
\ref{section:spring:somexplanation}) quantifies the similarity between
the expression profiles. The A7 and C6 copies and the A2 copy have high
similarity between their expression profiles, while the C2a and Cnn
copies have very low expression and do not show regulatory similarity to
the other \emph{BnAP1} copies.}\label{figure:3xx:ap1apex}
\end{figure}

One of the key behaviours observed in many of the expression traces of the floral integrators in Westar was an increase in expression after the vernalization treatment .
All expressed *BnLFY* copies, the A7 and C6 copies of *BnFT* and *BnAP1* in the apex, five of the six *BnSOC1* and *BnFD* copies in the apex, and the C3 and A10 copies of *BnTFL1* all exhibit a post-cold increase in the spring variety (Section \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators}).
To determine if this regulation is maintained in the winter variety, the expression of these copies was investigated.
With the exception of *BnTFL1.A10*, these copies are expressed in the winter variety and increase in expression after the cold treatment (Figures \ref{figure:3xx:ftleaf}, \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}, \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}, \ref{figure:3xx:fdleafapex}, \ref{figure:3xx:lfyapex}, and \ref{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}).
As a consequence of this similarity, many of the same genes are assigned to the same regulatory modules in Tapidor as they are in Westar.
All *BnLFY* copies again have a *redundant* pattern of regulatory module assignment in both varieties (Figures \ref{figure:3xx:lfyapex} and \ref{figure:231:lfyapex}).
Likewise, the A7 and C6 copies of both *BnFT* and *BnAP1* display similar expression profiles in both varieties.
Therefore, a vernalization requirement does not seem to completely abolish the upregulation of floral integrators during the floral transition.
This suggests that the *BnFLC* copies that exhibit expression reactivation post-cold do not repress any of the floral integrators that display upregulation in both varieties.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

the expression profiles. Regulatory divergence between the copies is
observed, both in terms of expression pattern and the magnitude of
expression.}\label{figure:3xx:soc1apex}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

expression.}\label{figure:3xx:soc1leaf}
\end{figure}

*SOC1* is a direct target of *FLC* in Arabidopsis[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @searle_transcription_2006].
However, homologues of this gene do not seem to be impacted by the vernalization response in Tapidor.
In the apex in Westar, the *BnSOC1* genes exhibit peaks in expression during and after the vernalization treatment, with the ratio of expression magnitudes between these peaks varying between the copies (section \ref{section:spring:soc1}).
In both varieties, the C4 and A3 copies exhibit the most extreme of these ratios, with *BnSOC1.A3.Random* peaking in expression post-cold and the *BnSOC1.C4* copy peaking during the cold (Figures \ref{figure:227:soc1apex} and \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}).
That these observations are not altered in the winter variety suggests that the effect of a cold requirement impacts the regulation of all *BnSOC1* genes similarly.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics{figuredirectory/apex_lfy.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Expression traces for the \emph{BnLFY} genes in the

SOM based method (discussed in section
\ref{section:spring:somexplanation}) quantifies the similarity between
the expression profiles. All four copies exhibit very similar expression
profiles.}\label{figure:3xx:lfyapex}
\end{figure}

Expression magnitude differences between copies are also maintained in the winter variety.
Of the A7 and C6 copies of *BnAP1*, *BnAP1.C6a* has the lowest maximum expression in both varieties.
*BnAP1.C2a.Random* and *BnAP1.Cnn.Random* are both lowly expressed copies that display a slight peak during vernalization in both varieties (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}).
The tissue-specific differences in *BnSOC1* expression observed in the spring variety are conserved in the winter variety, with *BnSOC1.A3.Random*, and *BnSOC1.A4.Random* and *BnSOC1.A4* being most highly expressed in the apex and leaf respectively.

It might be expected, given how genes have diverged in Arabidopsis[@blanc_functional_2004], that certain homologues of floral integrators would be more vernalization responsive than others.
If this was the case, one would expect the regulatory divergence between homologues in Tapidor to be greater than that observed in Westar.
However, the expression of the floral integrator homologues in Tapidor reveals that this is not the case.

### Conclusions

When regulatory or protein interaction networks are duplicated in whole genome multiplication events it has been found that the duplicated networks can diverge into distinct networks[@blanc_functional_2004].
When this occurs, it is possible that the networks will diverge to be more or less sensitive to particular environmental inputs.
To investigate whether this has occurred with the regulatory network underlying flowering in *B.\ napus*, the expression of the floral integrators was compared between varieties.
The vernalization response does not result in all floral integrators exhibiting increased regulatory divergence, as might be observed if a particular set of floral integrators had increased vernalization sensitivity.
Instead, the main difference between the varieties is a delay in the increase of floral activators post-cold in the winter variety, suggesting that the vernalization requirement is acting to repress the floral transition through influencing the expression of all homologues.
This is in line with the findings at the global level, where vernalization was found to delay development (section \ref{section:winter:som}).

Although there is not evidence for a vernalization-specific regulatory network, certain *B.\ napus* homologues of floral integrators do exhibit different regulatory behaviour in the winter variety.
Analysis of *BnFT* copies suggests that certain copies are more vernalization sensitive than others, with the A2 and C2 copies exhibiting a more severe reduction in expression across the entire time series relative to the A7 and C6 copies.
These findings contradict with results from other studies of vernalization requiring lines of *B.\ napus*, where the A7 and C6 copies were silenced prior to cold, while the A2 copy was expressed[@wang_promoter_2012].
The response of the *BnFT* genes to vernalization, therefore, may be variety specific.
That A2 and C2 are not expressed at all, even when the Tapidor plants have undergone the floral transition, potentially suggests that the A2 and C2 copies are not required for the floral transition in *B.\ napus*.
This analysis will require further validation, as potentially the reduced expression of *BnFT* genes in the Tapidor leaf is a consequence of the leaves being older when *BnFT* expression increases in Tapidor relative to Westar.
Repression is also observed for the *BnSOC1* genes.
Although the copies maintain their general expression profiles, the expression magnitude of the copies is greatly reduced in the winter variety.
Although the *BnTFL1* genes have not been found to have a vernalization requirement in Arabidopsis, these genes also show reduced expression in the winter compared to the spring *B.\ napus* variety.
This may be a result of the highly interconnected nature of the floral integrators, such that the reduction in expression is indirect (Figure \ref{figure:1xx:floralnetwork}).
Alternatively, *BnFLC* copies may directly regulate the expression of *BnTFL1* genes, representing an additional manner in which the requirement for cold can alter flowering behaviour.
Finally, single copies of *BnAP1* and *BnFD* have altered expression patterns in the winter compared to the spring.
In both cases, the homologues with novel regulation in the winter variety acquire expression profiles similar to other homologues.
This suggests that these two genes have potentially lost regulatory elements in Westar.
Without further work it is difficult to determine whether the differences observed between varieties are due to the vernalization requirement or due to between variety differences.
Studies that introgress *BnFLC* genes from Tapidor to Westar would be able to discriminate between these two possibilities.
Alternatively, assessing the expression of the floral integrators could be done in a larger collection of *B.\ napus* varieties, to determine more consistent differences between winter and spring varieties.
