## Introduction

Vernalization requirement is a key agronomic trait of Brassica napus, with spring varieties constituting the majority of oilseed rape growth in Canada and winter varieties being grown in Europe.
Understanding the vernalization response is therefore a key part of any analysis of the flowering time pathway in the crop.

A finding from Arabidopsis (maybe?! TODO) found that duplicated regulatory networks tend to form distinct regulatory networks.
It is possible that each of these networks becomes specialised towards particular roles.
This specialization could be a spatiotemporal one, with a diverged regulatory networks being expressed in particular tissues or at particular points in development.
Alternatively, especially with regulatory networks that integrate multiple signals, the networks could diverge to bias particular environmental inputs.
In the case of flowering in Brassica napus, one diverged set of floral integrators could be particularly sensitive to the vernalization pathway.
If this was the case, then the vernalization specific integrators would be the best suited for future breeding efforts to alter the vernalization pathway.

In this chapter I will discuss the expression of floral integrators and key vernalization pathway genes in the *B. napus* winter variety Tapidor.
The expression of these genes will be compared to the expression of the same genes in Westar in order to answer two key questions.
The first is which vernalization pathway genes are most likely to be mediating the vernalization response in Tapidor, based on their expression pattern and their differential expression between the spring and winter varieties?
The second is linked to the method of regulatory network evolution following gene duplication outlined above: which key floral integrators, if any, are expressed differently in Tapidor?
Differentially expressed floral integrators in the vernalization requiring line would suggest those genes are more sensitive to the environmental input than their homologues.
This would provide evidence for the hypothesis of regulatory networks diverging to become biased towards, or more sensitive to, particular inputs.
The alternative hypothesis is that the vernalization response could affect all regulatory networks equally.
