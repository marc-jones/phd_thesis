## Expression behaviour of floral integrators

A potential avenue for the production of *B. napus* varieties with altered flowering time is via changes to the regulation of floral integrators.
This is evidenced by studies that characterised the phenotypes of *A. thaliana* plants constituently expressing the genes, with the plants frequently showing alterations to flowering time and flower morphology[@mandel_gene_1995; @kardailsky_activation_1999; @samach_distinct_2000; @lee_agamous_like_2000; @weigel_developmental_1995; @kobayashi_pair_1999; @teper_bamnolker_flowering_2005].
Other investigations have performed ectopic expression analyses with more specific promoters to understand the spatial aspects of a gene's function[@searle_transcription_2006].
Although the majority of flowering time variation is attributable to the vernalization requirement that *FLC* and *FRI* confer, different alleles of the floral integrators also have the potential to influence flowering time.
In *A. thaliana*, natural variation at the *CO* promoter impacts flowering time[@rosas_variation_2014], while variation at the *FT* orthologue in perennial ryegrass has also been found to be associated with flowering time[@skot_allelic_2011],
This is not surprising given the role these genes play in the integration of signals from multiple environmental pathways.
Modelling studies have confirmed that changes in the regulation of floral integrators have the potential to impact flowering time[@valentim_quantitative_2015; @dijk_floral_2017; @jaeger_interlocking_2013].
As a result of the potential flowering time differences mediated by floral integrators, the regulation of the genes were compared between the two varieties used to generate the *B. napus* expression time series.
As the expression of the floral integrators in Westar were discussed in depth in section \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators}, the behaviour of the genes in Tapidor will be investigated through comparisons to the spring variety to avoid repetition.
Despite differences in timing, the expression behaviours of the majority of floral integrators in the winter variety are in agreement with the spring variety, suggesting that these genes are not responsible for the flowering time differences observed between the varieties.
The differences identified, however, provide potential future avenues for dissecting the flowering response in *B. napus*.

### Similarities {#section:winter:floralsimilarities}

![**Expression traces for the *BnaAP1* genes in Tapidor in the apex.**](figuredirectory/exp_ap1_apex.pdf){#figure:3xx:ap1apex}

One of the key behaviours observed in many of the expression traces of the floral integrators in Westar was an increase in expression after the vernalization treatment.
All expressed *BnaLFY* copies, the A7 and C6 copies of *BnaFT* and *BnaAP1* in the apex, five of the six *BnaSOC1* and *BnaFD* copies in the apex, and the C3 and A10 copies of *BnaTFL1* all exhibit a post-cold increase in the spring variety (Section \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators}).
With the only exception of *BnaTFL1.A10*, these copies are expressed in the winter variety and also increase in expression after the cold treatment (Figures \ref{figure:3xx:ftleaf}, \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}, \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}, \ref{figure:3xx:fdleafapex}, \ref{figure:3xx:lfyapex}, & \ref{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}).
As a consequence of this similarity, many of the same genes are assigned to the same regulatory modules in Tapidor as they are in Westar.
All *BnaLFY* copies again have a *redundant* pattern of regulatory module assignment in both varieties.
Likewise, the A7 and C6 copies of both *BnaFT* and *BnaAP1* display expression patterns similar enough to be assigned to the same regulatory module in both varieties.

![**Expression traces for the *BnaSOC1* genes in Tapidor in the apex.**](figuredirectory/apex_soc1.pdf){#figure:3xx:soc1apex}

![**Expression traces for the *BnaSOC1* genes in Tapidor in the leaf.**](figuredirectory/leaf_soc1.pdf){#figure:3xx:soc1leaf}

In addition to the similarities in expression pattern being conserved between the two varieties, differences are also maintained.
The two *BnaTLF1* genes expressed in the apex in Tapidor (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}) are distinct from each other as they are in Westar (Figure \ref{figure:232:tfl1apex}).
Not only do the expression behaviours remain distinct, but the patterns of regulation are also recapitulated in the winter variety.
*BnaTFL1.C3* exhibits increases during and after the vernalization treatment and *BnaTFL1.Cnn.Random* gradually decreases in expression as the time series progresses in both varieties (Figure \ref{figure:232:tfl1apex} & \ref{figure:3xx:tfl1apex}).
The *BnaAP1* genes can be divided into two categories; copies that increase in expression post-cold and those do not.
Although the membership of those categories is marginally different between the varieties (discussed in section \ref{section:winter:floraldifferences}), the categories are also evident in the winter variety (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:ap1apex}).
As highlighted in section \ref{section:spring:soc1}, the *BnaSOC1* genes show peaks in expression during and after vernalization, with the ratio of expression magnitudes between these peaks varying between the copies.
In both the winter and spring varieties, the C4 and A3 copies exhibit the most extreme of these ratios, with *BnaSOC1.A3.Random* peaking in expression post-cold and the *BnaSOC1.C4* copy peaking during the cold (Figures \ref{figure:227:soc1apex} & \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}).

![**Expression traces for the *BnaFD* genes in Tapidor in the leaf and apex.**](figuredirectory/apex_leaf_fd.pdf){#figure:3xx:fdleafapex}

![**Expression traces for the *BnaLFY* genes in Tapidor in the apex.**](figuredirectory/apex_lfy.pdf){#figure:3xx:lfyapex}

Similarities in the magnitude of expression are also observed between the varieties.
Of the A7 and C6 copies of *BnaAP1*, *BnaAP1.C6a* has the lowest maximum expression in both varieties.
*BnaAP1.C2a.Random* and *BnaAP1.Cnn.Random* are both lowly expressed copies that display a slight peak during vernalization in both varieties.
The tissue specific differences in *BnaSOC1* expression observed in the spring variety seem to conserserved in the winter variety, with *BnaSOC1.A3.Random* most highly expressed in the apex and *BnaSOC1.A4.Random* and *BnaSOC1.A4* having large FPKM values in the leaf.
The copies exhibiting mid-vernalization and post-vernalization increases in spring varieties exhibit the same behaviour in the winter variety, with the relative heights of these expression peaks being similar between the spring and winter variety (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:soc1apex}).

A potential caveat of the regulatory divergence observed in the copies of floral integrators in the spring variety is that the differences may be variety specific (Section \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators}).
While the examples of regulatory divergence would still be of interest in studies of functional changes to genes after a genome multiplication event, the findings would be of limited application to other varieties.
That similar regulatory differences are observed between copies of floral integrators in the winter variety, however, suggests that this functional divergence between copies of floral integrators is a more general observation for the species.
The most striking finding is that the floral integrators that show an increase in expression post-cold in the spring variety all show increases in the winter variety, if they are expressed.

### Differences {#section:winter:floraldifferences}

Although the most striking similarity between the two varieties is that both have a number of genes displaying an increase in expression after the vernalization treatment, there is a consistent delay in the expression increase in Tapidor relative to Westar.
For the *BnaFT* and *BnaAP1* genes, the post-cold increase is seen in the first time point sampled after the vernalization treatment in the spring, whereas the increase in the winter variety is only seen at the final time point.
Likewise, *BnaLFY* and *BnaSOC1* genes peak in expression at the day 69 time point in spring and the day 83 time point in winter.
Finally, the *BnaFD* genes peak at day 67 in the spring and day 72 in the winter variety.
This delay corresponds with the flowering of the varieties, with the varieties reaching BBCH stage TODO at the day TODO and day TODO time points respectively for the spring and winter variety.
A similar delay is also observed when global correlations are calculated between the time points.
In the apex, global expression of genes from the day 72 time point in Westar shows highest correlation with the day 83 time point in Tapidor (Figure TODO).
This suggests that the delay in the expression increase is a result of the different developmental rates of the two varieties.
Interestingly, the time delay is not observed in the correlation plots for the leaf samples (Figure TODO).
However, the *BnaFT* genes expressed in the leaf in both varieties show a large difference in the timing of their increase (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:ftleaf}).
Therefore, although the leaf transcriptome in general seems to be influenced more by age rather than developmental stage (discussed in section \ref{}), this is not true for the *BnaFT* genes.

Although post-cold expression increases are maintained in both varieties, a number of other genes have altered regulation in Tapidor relative to Westar.
Within the apex, five of the six *BnaFD* copies display similar expression patterns between Tapidor and Westar.
However, the A1 copy shows markedly different regulation in the winter variety relative to the spring.
Firstly, *BnaFD.A1* exhibits an expression pattern similar to the A8 and C7 copies, resulting in the three genes sharing a regulatory module.
This is in stark contrast to the spring variety, where the A1 copy has a regulatory pattern completely distinct from the other copies.
This change causes the *BnaFD* genes in Tapidor to have a *gradated* pattern of regulatory module assignment, whereas in Westar they exhibited a *distinct* pattern.
The magnitude of expression is also different, with *BnaFD.A1* achieving the highest maximal expression value of all the other copies in Tapidor apex samples, whereas in Westar *BnaFD.A1* was one of the most lowly expressed copies.
In addition, whereas no *BnaFD* copy was expressed above the 2.0 FPKM threshold in the leaf in Westar, the *BnaFD.A1* copy was expressed in the leaf in Tapidor.
All of these observations suggest that the *BnaFD.A1* has a different function in the winter variety as opposed to the spring variety.

The regulatory module assignments made for the *BnaSOC1* genes in the leaf of the spring variety displayed a *gradated* pattern, indicative of the copies having relatively similar patterns of regulation.
In Tapidor a *unique* pattern is instead observed, with the Cnn, A5, and A3 copies clustering together and the other genes being assigned to individual modules.
This is the result of two differences in the regulation of these copies.
The first is an increase in expression at the final time point for three of the six copies; *BnaFD.A5*, *BnaFD.A3.Random*, and *BnaFD.Cnn.Random*.
The other difference is seen with the A5 and C4 copies.
In the spring variety these copies decrease in expression following the vernalization period to an intermediate expression level between the pre-cold and during cold expression minima and maxima, respectively.
These copies in the winter variety, however, remain relatively highly expression post-cold.
These two factors together result in increased divergence between the expression traces of the genes.

The *BnaAP1* genes in the spring variety were divided into three regulatory modules; one displaying an increase post-cold, one showing a transient increase during vernalization and one displaying partial behaviour of both (Figure \ref{section:spring:ap1}).
*BnaAP1.A2.Random* was uniquely assigned to the latter module in the spring variety.
In the winter variety, the post-vernalization increase of *BnaAP1.A2.Random* is exaggerated, with the magnitude of expression at the end of the time series being similar to the *BnaAP1.C6a* copy.
The transient increase during the vernalization period is still observed in the A2 copy in the winter variety.
However, as a result of the increase during vernalization being relatively slight in comparison to the increase at the final time point, the gene is assigned to the same regulatory module as the A7 and C6 copies.
As a result, in Tapidor, *BnaAP1.A2.Random* behaves more similarly to the A7 and C6 copies and to *AthAP1* in *A. thaliana*, than it does in the spring variety.

![**Expression traces for the *BnaFT* genes in Tapidor in the leaf.**](figuredirectory/exp_ft_leaf.pdf){#figure:3xx:ftleaf}

The floral integrators that show the largest change in their expression in the winter variety relative to the spring variety are the *BnaFT* and *BnaTFL1* genes.
In the leaf in the spring variety, four *BnaFT* copies are expressed, exhibiting high expression before and after the cold treatment (Figure \ref{section:spring:ft}).
In contrast in the winter variety, the *BnaFT.A2* and *BnaFT.C2.Random* copy are not expressed above 2.0 FPKM at any point during the time series.
This is particularly striking given that *BnaFT.A2* is the copy with the highest maximal expression level in Westar.
In terms of the expression traces, *BnaFT.A7* and *BnaFT.C6* return to pre-cold expression levels at the first time point after the cold treatment, while the same recovery of expression level requires an additional two days in the winter variety.
The magnitude of expression is markedly different between the winter and spring variety, with the copies in the spring variety having expression maxima 5-6 fold higher than maxima of the expressed copies in the winter variety.
In addition, while the spring variety had low, but detectable, expression of *BnaFT.A7* and *BnaFT.C6* in the apex, no such expression is observed in the winter variety.
Therefore, not only is the expression pattern different for the copies that are expressed, the magnitude of expression is dramatically reduced in the winter variety, in some cases resulting in the copy not being expressed.
A potential explanation for the difference in the magnitude of expression is due to an age related pathway, such as leaf senescence.
The sample correlation analysis suggested that the developmental stage of the plant influenced the first true leaf to a lesser extent than the apex (Section TODO).
Therefore, the expression level of the A7 and C6 copies in the winter variety may be reduced relative to the spring variety.

![**Expression traces for the *BnaTFL1* genes in Tapidor in the apex.**](figuredirectory/exp_tfl1_apex.pdf){#figure:3xx:tfl1apex}

The copies of *BnaTFL1* also have marked differences in expression between the two varieties.
As discussed in section \ref{section:winter:floralsimilarities} *BnaTFL1.C3* displays a somewhat similar expression trace in the two varieties.
However, the post-cold peak in expression occurs earlier in the winter variety at the day 67 time point, as opposed to day 69 in the spring variety.
In section \ref{section:spring:tfl1} I discuss the decrease in expression of *BnaTFL1.C3* at the final time point in light of the expression of *BnaLFY* and *BnaAP1*, suggesting that the increase in expression of these genes results in the observed decrease in *BnaTFL1.C3* expression.
However, for this to be the case the expression of *BnaLFY* and *BnaAP1* genes in the winter variety would have to increase in expression earlier in the time series, rather than later as observed.
Another potential explanation for the earlier peak in expression may be a result of the day 69 samples from Tapidor not being included in the sequencing.
Therefore, the expression of *BnaTFL1.C3* may in fact be very similar in both varieties, with the different timings of the floral transition between the two varieties having little effect on the expression of the gene.
Performing qPCR on the full set of samples taken from Tapidor, as was done in Westar (Figure \ref{fig:233:tfl1conservation}), would allow for this hypothesis to be tested.
The expression magnitude of the other *BnaTFL1* copies is reduced in the winter variety relative to the spring variety, with *BnaTFL1.Cnn.Random* being the only other copy expressed above 2.0 FPKM at at least one time point.
In addition to being lowly expressed, *BnaTFL1.Cnn.Random* lacks the peak in expression during the cold treatment in the winter compared to the spring variety.

### Discussion

The floral genes focussed on here allow for multiple environmental signals to be integrated into a coherent and appropriate response.
It is therefore possible that changes to the regulation of these genes could underlie differences in flowering time observed between different varieties.
To test if this was the case between a spring variety, Westar, and a winter variety, Tapidor, of *B. napus*, I compared the regulation of the key floral integrators between the varieties.
A common response of the floral integrators investigated here is an increase in expression during flowering.
For many of the floral integrators that exhibited such an increase in the spring variety, a common response was also observed in the winter variety.
This points to a general similarity in the roles these genes are playing in *B. napus*, regardless of the vernalization requirement of the variety.
This is somewhat expected, given that the majority of flowering time variation in *A. thaliana* was attributable to the activity of two loci; *FRI* and *FLC*.
This potentially allows the findings relating to the floral integrators identified in this work, such as differences in regulation observed between the copies, to be applied to both spring and winter varieties.
That similar differences between copies of floral integrators are observed in both the winter and spring variety adds support that the differences are relevant in the context of the regulatory network underlying flowering.
The most striking example of this is with the copies of *BnaSOC1*, where copies are highly expressed, and exhibit differences in expression traces and magnitudes between tissues.
As these differences were present in both the spring and winter variety, it suggests that the findings of further investigations into the functions of the *BnaSOC1* genes will be applicable to a larger number of varieties.

Despite broad similarities, differences were still observed between the two varieties.
The expression level of three of the six *BnaSOC1* genes in the leaf post-cold was higher in the winter variety than the spring variety, when considered relative to pre-cold levels.
A potential explanation for this behaviour can be proposed based on the activity of the gene in *A. thaliana*.
Overexpression of *SOC1* in a line sensitive to vernalization was able to accelerate the transition from juvenile plants to adult plants[@lee_agamous_like_2000].
Therefore, perhaps the higher relative expression of *BnaSOC1* post-cold in Tapidor is a consequence of the vernalization pathway influencing the expression of the genes[@moon_soc1_2003].
The largest differences between the varieties are observed with *BnaFD*, particularly the A1 copy, *BnaTFL1*, *BnaFT*, and a single *BnaAP1* copy.
That *BnaTFL1* and *BnaFT* both exhibit large differences is interesting as they are both closely related phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family proteins[@hanzawa_single_2005].
One striking difference is the expression magnitude of the *BnaFT* genes being much lower in the winter compared than the spring variety.
This effect may be a consequence of the age of the leaf being different between the winter and spring variety as the *BnaFT* genes were increasing in expression.
Alternatively, it may represent lower expression of the *BnaFT* genes in general, an hypothesis supported by the fact that *BnaFT* expression was not observed at all in the apex of Tapidor, unlike Westar.
As opposed to the upregulation of *BnaTFL1* post-cold being delayed in the winter variety, as was seen consistently with other genes exhibiting such regulatory behaviour, it occurred days before the spring variety.
A potential explanation for this difference is the sampling intervals used to generate the developmental time series; potentially the dynamics are similar between the winter and the spring and are missed due to the time period between samples increasing.
However, a more biologically relevant explanation is due to the role of *TFL1* as a repressor of floral development in the shoot meristem in *A. thaliana*[@alvarez_terminal_1992].
The earlier upregulation in the winter variety may have occurred to maintain the indeterminate nature of the shoot apex, as the plants were not then sufficiently induced to flower.
Determining whether the differences observed are the result of technical considerations, or an expected outcome of the regulatory network underlying flowering, will likely be possible with future experiments that resolve the expression of apical genes at a higher spatial and temporal resolution.

It is unlikely, given the function of the genes in *A. thaliana*, that the observed differences in floral integrators underlie the vernalization response in Tapidor.
It might be the case, however, that the observed differences are a result of the vernalization pathway affecting the expression of some copies of a gene more than others.
Testing this would involve taking a large number of lines, consisting of both winter and spring varieties, and investigating the regulation of the genes expressed differently.
Identifying such vernalization sensitive genes in this way would assist efforts to understand this flowering time pathway in *B. napus*, such as how the signal of prolonged cold is combined with other environmental cues by the floral integrators to mediate a coherent flowering response.
Indeed, it is tempting to postulate that floral integrators known to influence the response from multiple pathways would have supfunctionalized such that particular copies are specific in their response to a pathway.
