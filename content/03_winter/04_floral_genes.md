## Floral genes

Variation in the expression of floral integrators can influence the 

### Similarities 

Flowering time genes that peak in expression during the spring time series also tend to do so in the winter time series, but with a time delay reflecting the different developmental rates.

This is seen with five of the six copies of FD in the apex, that show similar expression patterns but with the peak in expression post cold delayed by 9 days.




### Differences

*BnaFD.A1* shows an expression pattern similar to A8 and C7, which was not the case in the spring variety where the copy was in a regulatory module on its own.
This change causes the FD genes in Tapidor to have a *gradated* pattern of regulatory module assignment.
In addition, the *BnaFD.A1* copy is copy with the highest maximal expression in the apex, whereas in wester it was one of the most lowly expressed copies.
In addition, the *BnaFD.A1* copy is expressed in the leaf in Tapidor, unlike its experssion in Westar and unlike any other copy.
These observations suggest that the *BnaFD.A1* has a different fucntion in the Winter variety.
