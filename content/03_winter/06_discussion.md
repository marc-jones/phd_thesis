## Discussion

A potential hypothesis to explain the higher number of genes exhibiting variety specific expression in the leaves of the winter variety is an increased sensory apparatus.
Expression of *FLC* in the vasculature, and the movement of *FT* from leaves to the apex[@zeevaart_florigen_2006; @zeevaart_leaf_produced_2008], positions the leaf as the organ that mediates the vernalization response in Arabidopsis.
The increased number of variety specific genes expressed in the leaf in Tapidor could potentially represent an expansion of this sensory machinery to allow the plant to respond to vernalization.
