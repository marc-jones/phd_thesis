## Discussion

A vernalization requirement is of great agronomic importance for the growth of *Brassica* crops[@friedt_oilseed_2009] and has a large effect on the floral transition[@song_remembering_2013].
To understand the vernalization response in *B. napus*, a time series of transcriptomes were compared between a winter variety, Tapidor, and a spring variety, Westar.
Comparing the number of expressed genes between varieties revealed that Tapidor had a greater number of *B. napus* genes exhibiting variety specific expression in the leaf compared to Westar.
This difference was also observed when *B. napus* genes were grouped based on sequence conservation to Arabidopsis genes, with Arabidopsis genes tending to have more expressed homologues in the leaf in Tapidor than in Westar.
A potential hypothesis to explain this observation is that an increased number of proteins are required in Tapidor.
Being the organ that intercepts the majority of light, the leaf senses photoperiod signals[@an_constans_2004; @suarez_lopez_constans_2001; @samach_distinct_2000; @yoo_constans_2005; @kobayashi_pair_1999].
Combined with the expression of *FLC* in the vasculature, and the movement of *FT* from leaves to the apex[@zeevaart_florigen_2006; @zeevaart_leaf_produced_2008], positions the leaf as the organ that mediates the vernalization and photoperiod response in Arabidopsis.
The increased number of variety specific genes expressed in the leaf in Tapidor could potentially represent an expansion of this sensory machinery to allow the plant to respond to vernalization.

Correlation analysis of the leaf and apex revealed that the transcriptomes develop similarly in both varieties, but the rates of change are dependent on the tissue.
In the first true leaf, samples grown for the same number of days displayed the greatest similarity in terms of correlation between varieties.
This was not the case in the apex, where developmentally similar samples from each variety exhibited the greatest similarity between their transcriptomes.
This suggests that the leaf transcriptome is influenced by the age of the tissue, whereas the apex transcriptome is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant.
This is counter to findings in Arabidopsis, where the onset of the floral transition was found to correlate strongly with the start of leaf senescence among a group of both early and late flowering accessions[@levey_natural_2005].
Unfortunately, concurrent transcriptomic analysis of apex and leaf samples are not available in order to determine whether these phenotypic observations translate to expression differences.
However, analysis of apex and leaf transcriptomes individually support the observations in *B. napus*.
Transcriptome analysis of laser dissected meristems identified a set of genes that became upregulated during Arabidopsis long day exposure that were enriched for floral development genes[@torti_analysis_2012].
The expression of these genes correlated with commitment of the apex to flower.
Conversely, analysis of the Arabidopsis leaf transcriptome from early growth stages to senescence revealed that diverse biological processes were more likely to have have correlated expression during senescence than during early development[@woo_programming_2016].
The authors concluded that this was due to the transcriptional changes during leaf senescence being tightly coordinated to maximise the remobilization of resources from leaves to developing tissues.
A potential explanation for why the transcriptomes of the leaf samples remain synchronised, despite the plants being at different developmental stages, is due to artificial selection for regular leaf senescence.
As both varieties used are oilseed rape varieties, remobilization of resources from old leaves may have been selected for.
This might be especially relevant for oilseed crops, where the formation of the pod canopy blocks light to older leaves.

Investigating the expression of *B. napus* homologues of vernalization pathway genes implicates certain copies of *BnFLC* as mediating the vernalization response in Tapidor.
During the cold, the expression of *FLC* in vernalization sensitive lines decreases, whereas in Arabidopsis spring accessions the expression of *FLC* is low throughout development[@michaels_flowering_1999].
The expression of two *BnFLC* copies were found that were lowly expressed in Westar and became stably repressed in Tapidor during cold; the A10 and A2 copies.
This finding confirms results from association studies, that found regions containing these genes to be associated with flowering time.
Using a *B. napus* Doubled Haploid mapping population between Ningyou7, a Chinese semi-winter variety, with a slight vernalization response, and Tapidor (TNDH population), a region on A10 was associated with flowering time variation in unvernalized conditions[@long_flowering_2007; @zou_comparative_2012].
As this region was not associated with flowering time variation when the plants were vernalized, it led the authors to propose *BnFLC.A10* as the copy conferring a vernalization requirement in *B. napus*[@zou_comparative_2012].
The A2 copy has also been found to be associated with flowering time in *B. napus* and *B. rapa*[@lou_quantitative_2007; @osborn_comparison_1997; @kole_evidence_2001; @xiao_brassica_2013; @zhao_brflc2_2010].
Interestingly, the effects of A10 and A2 on flowering were found to be additive in *B. napus*, suggesting that both copies are delaying the floral transition to some extent[@schranz_characterization_2002].
The other *BnFLC* copy identified in the TNDH population as being associated with flowering is A3b[@zou_comparative_2012].
In the transcriptome time series, *BnFLC.A3b* is expressed approximately 4\ fold lower in Westar relative to Tapidor before cold, and displays a cold-induced decrease in Tapidor.
However, the repression of the gene is not stable, and reactivation of expression is observed.
Expression reactivation is also observed post-cold in *BnFLC.C2*, while stable repression is observed in Westar.
Reactivation of *FLC* expression is observed in Arabidopsis when vernalization sensitive lines are not given adequate vernalization[@duncan_seasonal_2015; @shindo_variation_2006; @coustham_quantitative_2012].
This suggests that these particular copies have not received adequate cold in order to become fully repressed.
These copies do not, therefore, need to be fully repressed for the plants to flower.
This is consistent with findings from the TNDH mapping population, where *BnFLC.A3b* was detected in both vernalized and unvernalized conditions[@zou_comparative_2012].
Another association study utilizing a mapping population created using two spring lines (Skipton/Ag-Spectrum DH), that nonetheless exhibited slight vernalization responses, identified a region containing *BnFLC.C2* as being associated with flowering time[@raman_molecular_2012; @raman_genetic_2013; @zou_comparative_2012].
That these *BnFLC* are associated with flowering time in unvernalized growth conditions, and with a mapping population of two spring parents, suggests that the A3b and C2 copies do not confer a vernalization requirement, and may instead modulate the response to cold.
This is also in line with results from *B.\ rapa*[@schranz_characterization_2002] and *B.\ oleracea*[@irwin_nucleotide_2016], that also implicated A3 and C2 homologues of *FLC* with flowering time.
Despite being a spring variety, Westar has been found to respond to a vernalization treatment with accelerated flowering[@murphy_vernalization_1994].
Two *BnFLC* genes have high expression in Westar and exhibit stable, cold-induced repression; *BnFLC.A3a* and the aforementioned *BnFLC.C2*.
In addition to a region containing *BnFLC.C2*, a region containing *BnFLC.A3a* was also associated with flowering in the Skipton/Ag-Spectrum DH mapping population[@raman_molecular_2012; @raman_genetic_2013; @zou_comparative_2012].
It therefore seems likely that *BnFLC.A3a* and *BnFLC.C2* confer a weak vernalization response in Westar.
*BnFLC.A3a* is expressed at a similar levels in both Tapidor and Westar.
This suggests that the delay to flowering in Tapidor resulting from the expression of *BnFLC.A3a* could be epistatic to the delay conferred by other copies, such as the copies on chromosomes A2 or A10.
Finally, although divergence is observed in other vernalization pathway genes, the significance of the differences is difficult to judge based on our current mechanistic understanding.
Increased expression of *VIN3* and *MSI1* homologues in Tapidor compared to Westar may allow Tapidor to respond more dynamically to cold, or alternatively may be required to repress the higher levels of *BnFLC*.
This is supported by findings form *Arabidopsis arenosa* where higher expression of *VIN3* during cold was observed in vernalization requiring accessions relative to a rapid-cycling accession[@baduel_habitat_associated_2016].
For *BnFRI* genes, the lack of *BnFRI* expression in the spring variety could potentially explain the reduced expression of *BnFLC* genes in Westar.
However, this would require validating, especially as previous work on *FRI* homologues in *Brassicas* have not found *BnFRI.A10* to be associated with flowering time[@irwin_functional_2012; @wang_flowering_2011; @long_flowering_2007].

That *BnFLC.C2* exhibits reactivation in the winter and not the spring is interesting given findings from Arabidopsis.
In Arabidopsis the pre-vernalization expression level of *FLC* was found to not correlate with the vernalization response for different Arabidopsis accessions[@shindo_variation_2006; @werner_frigida_independent_2005].
Instead, variation in the efficiency of *FLC* silencing accounted for the observed natural variation in vernalization response[@shindo_variation_2006].
For *BnFLC.C2*, differences in both the initial expression value of the gene and the extent of silencing are present between varieties.
Tapidor has higher expression of the gene initially, and although the vernalization treatment causes a decrease in expression, the silencing is not stable.
The gene in Westar, however, is more lowly expressed initially and becomes stability expressed after cold treatment.
The reactivation of the copy in Tapidor parallels the reactivation of *FLC* in a Swedish variety of Arabidopsis, Lov-1.
The *FLC* in this accession required 9 weeks of cold at 5\ &deg;C to become fully silenced, as opposed to 4 weeks for a common laboratory strain, Col-FRI[@coustham_quantitative_2012; @duncan_seasonal_2015].
This difference was found to be an adaptive response, with the Lov-1 copy having a different optimal vernalization temperature than Col-FRI[@duncan_seasonal_2015].
Applying this to the differences in expression of *BnFLC.C2* between varieties poses two hypotheses.
The first is that the basal level of *BnFLC.C2* silencing in Westar is higher, resulting in a shorter vernalization period being required for stable silencing of the gene.
Alternatively, the optimum temperature at which the *BnFLC.C2* copy is repressed might be different.

![**The "underdetermined system" hypothesis.** Different *FLC* copies ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) with different sensitivities to cold allow for both the length and the severity of cold to be determined. **a** FLC-$\alpha$ is repressed more strongly at 5 &deg;C relative to 14 &deg;C. The result is that the level of *FLC*-$\alpha$ expression is the same at the end of the vernalization period. **b** *FLC*-$\beta$ repression is insensitive to the ](figuredirectory/discussion_figure.pdf){#figure:3xx:underdetermined}

Therefore, it seems that the *BnFLC* genes have diverged to either require different lengths of cold to become stably silenced or have different optima temperatures at which the silencing occurs.
Having multiple copies of *FLC* with potentially different requirements for cold has interesting implications for the vernalization pathway in *B. napus*, relative to Arabidopsis.
From experiments in Arabidopsis, vernalization has been shown to be a quantitative response; the more cold experienced, the more *FLC* expression is repressed[@michaels_flowering_1999; @shindo_variation_2006].
In addition, the severity of cold influences the rate of vernalization, where severity of cold is used to refer to the temperature used for the vernalization treatment.
In thorough experiments using five different Arabidopsis accessions, different lengths of cold, and different vernalization temperatures, Duncan et al. (2015) revealed that the efficacy of vernalization was dependent on all three factors; genotype, length of cold, and severity of cold[@duncan_seasonal_2015].
The interaction between the length of cold and the severity of cold provides a hypothesis for the retention of *FLC* copies in *B. napus*, and their apparent divergence in vernalization response; the "underdetermined system" hypothesis.
This hypothesis states that additional copies of *FLC* allow regulatory responses to respond separately to the length of cold and to the vernalization temperature.
Consider the level of *FLC* expression ($FLC_{t}$) after a vernalization period of length $t$ as a function of the initial *FLC* expression level ($FLC_{0}$), the length of vernalization, and the rate of *FLC* repression ($f(T)$), which is itself a function of temperature ($T$).
Assuming *FLC* expression decreases in a linear fashion at a constant temperature, $FLC_{t}$ can be expressed as:

$$ FLC_{t} = FLC_{0} - tf(T) $$

Assuming that the initial level of *FLC* is the same for all plants of the same genotype, the level of *FLC* expression after cold is dependent solely on the length and the severity of cold.
Therefore, with only a single *FLC* locus, a plant is not able to distinguish between a long, mild period of cold and a short, severe period of cold (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:underdetermined}a).
This is the case in the Var2-6 Arabidopsis accession, where 6 weeks of cold at 5\ &deg;C and 12 weeks of cold at 14\ &deg;C resulted in the plants flowering at approximately the same time[@duncan_seasonal_2015].
As there is only one equation, and two unknowns, the system is underdetermined.
The presence of an additional *FLC* copy, with a different sensitivity to the severity of cold (represented by the rate of *FLC* repression having a different relationship with temperature; $g(T)$), would provide an additional equation, allowing both the length of cold and the temperature experienced to be determined from the expression levels of both *FLC* copies (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:underdetermined}a).
This hypothesis assumes that *FLC* repression is the sole mediator of the vernalization response, which it is not[@michaels_loss_2001], and that *BnFLC* copies have different molecular activities, such as different target genes, in order to enact different transcriptional programmes.
It also assumes that it would be beneficial to the plant to respond to the length and severity of cold separately.
However, as genes in the vernalization response have been found to have pleiotropic effects, such as on plant architecture[@scarcelli_antagonistic_2007], this seems likely.
Regardless it demonstrates a potential use for additional *FLC* copies; to allow the length of cold and the severity of cold to be dissected.
Testing the "underdetermined system" hypothesis could be done by performing similar vernalization experiments as Duncan et al. with *B. napus*[@duncan_seasonal_2015].

Taking the expression of *BnFLC* genes (section \ref{section:winter:flc}) and the floral integrators (sections \ref{section:spring:floralintegrators} and \ref{section:winter:floralintegrators}) together, the effects of a vernalization requirement on the transcription of floral integrators can begin to be dissected.
Two genes directly repressed by *FLC* in Arabidopsis are *SOC1* and *FT*[@lee_agamous_like_2000; @michaels_integration_2005].
In line with this, both of these genes exhibit lower expression in Tapidor relative to Westar.
Not only is the magnitude of expression lower in Tapidor, but the regulatory profile varies also.
In Westar, the expression of the *BnFT* genes was initially high at the first time point, suggesting that the plants were competent to flower, but had not yet undergone the floral transition.
However, the *BnFT* copies expressed in Tapidor only increased at the final time point.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that the *BnFLC.A3a* gene, that is expressed similarly in both Tapidor and Westar, influences the expression of *BnFT* genes.
The expression of *SOC1* in Arabidopsis is directly repressed by *FLC* expression, particularly in the apex[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006; @hepworth_antagonistic_2002; @searle_transcription_2006].
In addition to the vernalization pathway, the expression of *SOC1* gene is also regulated by the photoperiod pathway[@samach_distinct_2000; @onouchi_mutagenesis_2000].
The interaction of the vernalization and photoperiod pathways on the expression of *SOC1* was found to be additive[@schmid_dissection_2003].
In a transcriptomic analysis of the Arabidopsis apex, the upregulation of *SOC1* during the floral transition was found to occur in the presence and absence of *FLC*.
However, the overall expression of the gene was much lower[@schmid_dissection_2003].
This same additive interaction is observed for all *BnSOC1* genes in both the apex and the leaf in *B. napus*
Finally, in the same manner as *BnFT* and *BnSOC1*, the expression levels of *BnTFL1* were lower in Tapidor than in Westar.
This is interesting given the relatedness of *BnFT* and *BnTFL1*[@ahn_divergent_2006; @hanzawa_single_2005; @ho_structural_2014], despite *TFL1* not previously being implicated as a direct *FLC* target.
Indeed the *TFL1* gene is not identified when the binding of *FLC* is assessed in a genome-wide manner[@deng_flowering_2011; @mateos_combinatorial_2015].
This therefore suggests that the *BnTFL1* genes may be downregulated indirectly by *BnFLC* genes.
In addition, as opposed to the post-cold upregulation of *BnTFL1.C3* being delayed in the winter variety, as was seen consistently with other genes exhibiting such regulatory behaviour, it occurred days before the spring variety.
An explanation for this difference is the sampling intervals used to generate the developmental time series.
Potentially the dynamics are similar between the winter and the spring, and are missed in the transcriptomic time series due to the time period between sampling dates changing.
A more biologically relevant explanation is due to the role of *TFL1* as a repressor of floral development in the shoot meristem in Arabidopsis[@alvarez_terminal_1992].
The earlier upregulation in the winter variety may therefore occur to maintain the indeterminate nature of the shoot apex, as the plants were not then sufficiently induced to flower.

A study conducted in Arabidopsis found that when genes that interact are duplicated, the expression of the genes tends to diverge and form distinct regulatory networks[@blanc_functional_2004].
It is then possible that each of these networks becomes specialised towards particular roles.
In the case of *B. napus*, multiple copies of floral integrators may have resulted in multiple parallel regulatory networks forming and becoming specialised to particular inputs or locations.
However, in general the vernalization requirement in Tapidor seems to influence the expression of all copies of a floral integrator.
Although exceptions exist in the A1 copy of *BnFD* and the A2 copy of *BnAP1*, it is difficult to determine whether this represents a difference due to a vernalization requirement or a difference due to varietal divergence.
Testing this would require analysing the expression of these potential vernalization sensitive homologues in a larger panel of *B. napus* lines.

By comparing the expression of *BnFLC* homologues between varieties and between tissues, biologically relevant differences were identified.
These results highlight the benefits of being able to make these kinds of comparison between expression profiles.
The next chapter will introduce a tool developed to allow such comparisons to be quickly and easily made.
The web application, dubbed the Oilseed Rape Developmental Expression Resource, allows the vast dataset collected in this study to be searched and plotted to facilitate comparisons between genes and homologues.
