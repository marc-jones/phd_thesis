The homologue of *D. melanogaster* Esc, *FIE1*, is the only annotated Arabidopsis homologue of the gene, and is a component of all identified PRC2 complexes in the plant[@pien_polycomb_2007; @kohler_programming_2008].
In *B. napus* there are three copies of the gene expressed; the A1 and C1 copies are expressed in both tissues while the Ann copy is only expressed in the apex (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:fie1apex}).
Although the copies are expressed very similarly in both varieties, the genes show tissue specific expression.
In the leaf, *BnFIE1.A1* is relatively lowly expressed and exhibits a gradual increase across development.
*BnFIE1.C1* is more highly expressed than the A1 copy, and shows more pronounced increase in expression during the time series.
In the apex all copies of *BnFIE1* are expressed more highly (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:fie1apex}).
The expression profiles exhibited by the A1 and C1 copies decrease across development, in contrast to their behaviour in the leaf.
Although *BnFIE1.Ann.Random* is above the expression threshold, the expression is 3 to 4 fold lower relative the the A1 and C1 copies, suggesting this copy does not play as important a role in the function of PRC2 in *B. napus*.

\end{figure}

The histone methyltransferase *SWN* is associated with the PRC2 complex that influences the vernalization response in Arabidopsis.
As with *B. napus* copies of *VRN2*, the *BnSWN* genes are relatively consistent in their expression in both varieties and tissues, with slight increases in expression during the cold treatment (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:eza1apex}).
Although an additional *BnSWN* copy is expressed above the expression threshold in the leaf (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:eza1apex}) the expression is very low and only just above the 2.0 FPKM threshold.
Due to this low expression the relevance of the gene to the vernalization response is likely to be low.

\end{figure}

*VIL1* shows only a slight decrease in expression during the vernalization period, with relatively constant expression after the cold (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:vil1}).
This is the case in both varieties, with the magnitude of expression of both copies being very similar in both the winter and the spring.
The A7b copy is expressed in both the apex and the leaf, while the C7b copy is only detected in the apex, suggesting potential tissue specific expression of the copies.
The expression patterns of *BnVIL1* deviate from that of *VIL1* in Arabidopsis, in that the expression was found to increase during short day growth[@sung_phd_2006].
However, the expression in both leaf and apex is consistent with results from the model species[@greb_phd_2007].

\end{figure}

*VIL2* has been found to be associated with the vernalization associated PRC2[@hennig_diversity_2009], although down regulation of the gene did not affect flowering time of vernalized plants[@greb_phd_2007].
However, an increase in expression of the gene during vernalization has also been reported[@kim_coordination_2013], making the role of the gene during vernalization somewhat ambiguous.
Five copies of the gene are expressed in *B. napus*, all of which show remarkable similarities in both expression profile and magnitude in the apex (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:vil2apex}) and leaf (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:vil2leaf}).

\end{figure}

Interestingly, three of the copies exhibit tissue specific responses to the cold treatment.
The A1, A8, and Ann, and C1 copies all exhibit increases during the vernalization period in the apex (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:vil2apex}), yet show expression decreases in the leaf (Figure \ref{figure:3xx:vil2leaf}).
As the behaviours of these genes are so similar between the varieties, however, it is unlikely that they directly contribute to the flowering time differences observed between Westar and Tapidor.
