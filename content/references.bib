	abstract = {Duplicated genes can contribute to the evolution of new functions and they are common in eukaryotic genomes. After duplication, genes can show divergence in their sequence and/or expression patterns. Qualitative complementary expression, or reciprocal expression, is when only one copy is expressed in some organ or tissue types and only the other copy is expressed in others, indicative of regulatory subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. From analyses of two microarray data sets with 83 different organ types, developmental stages, and cell types in Arabidopsis thaliana, we determined that 30\% of whole-genome duplicate pairs and 38\% of tandem duplicate pairs show reciprocal expression patterns. We reconstructed the ancestral state of expression patterns to infer that considerably more cases of reciprocal expression resulted from gain of a new expression pattern (regulatory neofunctionalization) than from partitioning of ancestral expression patterns (regulatory subfunctionalization). Pollen was an especially common organ type for expression gain, resulting in contrasting expression of some duplicates in pollen. Many of the gene pairs with reciprocal expression showed asymmetric sequence rate evolution, consistent with neofunctionalization, and the more rapidly evolving copy often showed a more restricted expression pattern. A gene with reciprocal expression in pollen, involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction, has evolved more rapidly than its paralog, and it shows evidence for a new function in pollen. This study indicates the evolutionary importance of reciprocal expression patterns between gene duplicates, showing that they are common, often associated with regulatory neofunctionalization, and may be a factor allowing for retention and divergence of duplicated genes.},

	abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates.
For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation.
Sidow (1996, p. 717)
On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene.
Walsh (1995, p. 426)
Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely.
Nadeau and Sankoff (1997, p. 1259)
Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

Because genome-wide duplication events duplicate whole molecular networks it is of interest to investigate how these networks evolve subsequent to such events. Although genome duplications are generally followed by massive gene loss, at least part of the network is usually retained in duplicate and can rewire to execute novel functions. Alternatively, the network can remain largely redundant and as such confer robustness against mutations. The increasing availability of high-throughput data makes it possible to study evolution following whole genome duplication events at the network level. Here we discuss how the use of ‘omics’ data in network analysis can provide novel insights on network redundancy and rewiring and conclude with some directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements and regulatory networks have diverged considerably in duplicated genes., Plant genomes contain large numbers of duplicated genes that contribute to the evolution of new functions. Following duplication, genes can exhibit divergence in their coding sequence and their expression patterns. Changes in the cis-regulatory element landscape can result in changes in gene expression patterns. High-throughput methods developed recently can identify potential cis-regulatory elements on a genome-wide scale. Here, we use a recent comprehensive data set of DNase I sequencing-identified cis-regulatory binding sites (footprints) at single-base-pair resolution to compare binding sites and network connectivity in duplicated gene pairs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We found that duplicated gene pairs vary greatly in their cis-regulatory element architecture, resulting in changes in regulatory network connectivity. Whole-genome duplicates (s) have approximately twice as many footprints in their promoters left by potential regulatory proteins than do tandem duplicates (s). The s have a greater average number of footprint differences between paralogs than s. The footprints, in turn, result in more regulatory network connections between s and other genes, forming denser, more complex regulatory networks than shown by s. When comparing regulatory connections between duplicates, s had more pairs in which the two genes are either partially or fully diverged in their network connections, but fewer genes with no network connections than the s. There is evidence of younger s and s having fewer unique connections compared with older duplicates. This study provides insights into cis-regulatory element evolution and network divergence in duplicated genes.},

When flowering started adults obtained pollen from flowers rather than from buds. They laid their eggs in the buds but not in the flowers. Larvae moved from flower to flower up the raceme and caused no damage. Probably many podless stalks have been wrongly attributed to pollen beetle damage.Overwintered seed weevils caused no damage by feeding on rape pods. New generation seed weevils caused some loss of seed weight and viability when feeding on pods of spring rape; this is probably unimportant on a field scale.Pollen beetles and seed weevils mated from mid-May until the emergence of new generation adults; these did not mate before hibernating.},

        abstract = {The genomic origins of rape oilseed
Many domesticated plants arose through the meeting of multiple genomes through hybridization and genome doubling, known as polyploidy. Chalhoub et al. sequenced the polyploid genome of Brassica napus, which originated from a recent combination of two distinct genomes approximately 7500 years ago and gave rise to the crops of rape oilseed (canola), kale, and rutabaga. B. napus has undergone multiple events affecting differently sized genetic regions where a gene from one progenitor species has been converted to the copy from a second progenitor species. Some of these gene conversion events appear to have been selected by humans as part of the process of domestication and crop improvement.
Science, this issue p. 950
Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) was formed {\textasciitilde}7500 years ago by hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea, followed by chromosome doubling, a process known as allopolyploidy. Together with more ancient polyploidizations, this conferred an aggregate 72× genome multiplication since the origin of angiosperms and high gene content. We examined the B. napus genome and the consequences of its recent duplication. The constituent An and Cn subgenomes are engaged in subtle structural, functional, and epigenetic cross-talk, with abundant homeologous exchanges. Incipient gene loss and expression divergence have begun. Selection in B. napus oilseed types has accelerated the loss of glucosinolate genes, while preserving expansion of oil biosynthesis genes. These processes provide insights into allopolyploid evolution and its relationship with crop domestication and improvement.
The polyploid genome of oilseed rape exhibits evolution through homologous gene conversion.

We used Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup for investigating the consequences of genome triplication, such as structural and functional evolution. The extent of gene loss (fractionation) among triplicated genome segments varies, with one of the three copies consistently retaining a disproportionately large fraction of the genes expected to have been present in its ancestor. Variation in the number of members of gene families present in the genome may contribute to the remarkable morphological plasticity of Brassica species.

Recent advances have shed light on two fundamental questions regarding gene duplication: which genes tend to undergo duplication? And how does natural selection subsequently act on them? Genomic data suggest that different gene classes tend to be retained after single-gene and whole-genome duplications. We also know that functional differences between duplicate genes can originate in several different ways, including mutations that directly impart new functions, subdivision of ancestral functions and selection for changes in gene dosage. Interestingly, in many cases the 'new' function of one copy is a secondary property that was always present, but that has been co-opted to a primary role after the duplication.},

Valid fossil calibration points are essential to the accurate estimation of divergence dates, but for many groups of flowering plants fossil evidence is unavailable or limited. Arabidopsis thaliana, the primary genetic model in plant biology and the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, belongs to one such group, the plant family Brassicaceae. Thus, the timing of A. thaliana evolution and the history of its genome have been controversial. We bring previously overlooked fossil evidence to bear on these questions and find the split between A. thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata occurred about 13 Mya, and that the split between Arabidopsis and the Brassica complex (broccoli, cabbage, canola) occurred about 43 Mya. These estimates, which are two- to threefold older than previous estimates, indicate that gene, genomic, and developmental evolution occurred much more slowly than previously hypothesized and that Arabidopsis evolved during a period of warming rather than of cooling. We detected a 2- to 10-fold shift in species diversification rates on the branch uniting Brassicaceae with its sister families. The timing of this shift suggests a possible impact of the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction on their radiation and that Brassicales codiversified with pierid butterflies that specialize on mustard-oil–producing plants.},

Painting of pachytene chromosomes of Calepina, Conringia, and Sisymbrium species (2n = 14, 16), traditionally placed in tribe Brassiceae, showed one homeologous copy of the Arabidopsis contig, while the remaining taxa of the tribe (2n = 14–30) revealed three, and three Brassica species (2n = 34, 36, and 38) and Erucastrum gallicum (2n = 30) had six copies corresponding to the 8.7-Mb segment. The multiple homeologous copies corresponded structurally to the Arabidopsis segment or were rearranged by inversions and translocations within the diploidized genomes. These chromosome rearrangements accompanied by chromosome fusions/fissions led to the present-day chromosome number variation within the Brassiceae. Phylogenetic relationships based on the chloroplast 5′-trnL (UAA)–trnF(GAA) region and estimated divergence times based on sequence data of the chalcone synthase gene are congruent with comparative painting data and place Calepina, Conringia, and Sisymbrium outside the clade of Brassiceae species with triplicated genomes. Most likely, species containing three or six copy pairs descended from a common hexaploid ancestor with basic genomes similar to that of Arabidopsis.

Circadian rhythms contribute to evolutionary fitness, suggesting that circadian rhythmicity may also contribute to agricultural productivity. Therefore, we extend our study of the plant circadian clock to Brassica rapa, an agricultural crop. Since its separation from Arabidopsis, B. rapa has undergone whole genome triplication and subsequent diploidization that has involved considerable gene loss. We find that circadian clock genes are preferentially retained relative to comparison groups of their neighboring genes, a set of randomly chosen genes, and a set of housekeeping genes broadly conserved in eukaryotes. The preferential retention of clock genes is consistent with the gene dosage hypothesis, which predicts preferential retention of highly networked or dose-sensitive genes. Two gene families encoding transcription factors that play important roles in the plant core oscillator—the PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS, including TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1, and the REVEILLE family, including CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL—exhibit preferential retention consistent with the gene dosage hypothesis, but a third gene family, including ZEITLUPE, that encodes F-Box proteins that regulate posttranslational protein stability offers an exception.},

Using a variety of experimental approaches we have analysed the TFL1 promoter to elucidate its functional structure. TFL1 expression is based on distinct cis -regulatory regions, the most important being located 3′ of the coding sequence. Our results indicate that TFL1 expression in the shoot apical versus lateral inflorescence meristems is controlled through distinct cis -regulatory elements, suggesting that different signals control expression in these meristem types. Moreover, we identified a cis -regulatory region necessary for TFL1 expression in the vegetative shoot and required for a wild-type flowering time, supporting that TFL1 expression in the vegetative meristem controls flowering time. Our study provides a model for the functional organisation of TFL1 cis -regulatory regions, contributing to our understanding of how developmental pathways are integrated at the genomic level of a key regulator to control plant architecture.},

The populations resulted from crosses between the following accessions: Rapid cycling, Chinese cabbage, Yellow sarson, Pak choi, and a Japanese vegetable turnip variety. A total of 27 QTL affecting 20 morphological traits were detected, including eight QTL for flowering time, six for seed traits, three for growth-related traits and 10 for leaf traits. One major QTL was found for turnip formation. Principal component analysis and co-localization of QTL indicated that some loci controlling leaf and seed-related traits and those for flowering time and turnip formation might be the same. The major flowering time QTL detected in all populations on linkage group R02 co-localized with BrFLC2. One major QTL, controlling turnip formation, was also mapped at this locus.

Brassica rapa represents a very close relative, with its triplicated genome, with subgenomes having evolved by genome fractionation. The question of whether this genome fractionation is a random process, or whether specific genes are preferentially retained, such as flowering time (Ft) genes that play a role in the extreme morphological variation within the B. rapa species (displayed by the diverse morphotypes), is addressed. Data are presented showing that indeed Ft genes are preferentially retained, so the next intriguing question is whether these different orthologues of Arabidopsis Ft genes play similar roles compared with Arabidopsis, and what is the role of these different orthologues in B. rapa. Using a genetical–genomics approach, co-location of flowering quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and expression QTLs (eQTLs) resulted in identification of candidate genes for flowering QTLs and visualization of co-expression networks of Ft genes and flowering time. A major flowering QTL on A02 at the BrFLC2 locus co-localized with cis eQTLs for BrFLC2, BrSSR1, and BrTCP11, and trans eQTLs for the photoperiod gene BrCO and two paralogues of the floral integrator genes BrSOC1 and BrFT. It is concluded that the BrFLC2 Ft gene is a major regulator of flowering time in the studied doubled haploid population.},

        abstract = {Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is a major oil crop which is grown worldwide. Adaptation to different environments and regional climatic conditions involves variation in the regulation of flowering time. Winter types have a strong vernalization requirement whereas semi-winter and spring types have a low vernalization requirement or flower without exposure to cold, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, FRIGIDA (FRI) is a key regulator which inhibits floral transition through activation of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a central repressor of flowering which controls vernalization requirement and response. Here, four FRI homologues in B. napus were identified by BAC library screening and PCR-based cloning. While all homologues are expressed, two genes were found to be differentially expressed in aerial plant organs. One of these, BnaA.FRI.a, was mapped to a region on chromosome A03 which co-localizes with a major flowering time quantitative trait locus in multiple environments in a doubled-haploid mapping population. Association analysis of BnaA.FRI.a revealed that six SNPs, including at least one at a putative functional site, and one haplotype block, respectively, are associated with flowering time variation in 248 accessions, with flowering times differing by 13–19 d between extreme haplotypes. The results from both linkage analysis and association mapping indicate that BnaA.FRI.a is a major determinant of flowering time in oilseed rape, and suggest further that this gene also contributes to the differentiation between growth types. The putative functional polymorphisms identified here may facilitate adaptation of this crop to specific environments through marker-assisted breeding.},

In the reciprocal experiment, expression of Arabidopsis FLC (AtFLC) in an early flowering B. napus cultivar delayed flowering by 2–6 weeks, confirming the requirement of this gene for floral repression. In B. napus, we show that late flowering and responsiveness to vernalization correlate with the level of BnFLC mRNA expression. The different BnFLC genes show differential expression in leaves, stems and shoot tips, but expression is not detectable in roots. Vernalization dramatically reduces the level of BnFLC transcript and restores early flowering in the winter cultivar Colombus. We conclude that BnFLC genes confer winter requirement in B. napus and account for the major vernalization-responsive flowering time differences in the different cultivars of B. napus in a manner analogous to that of AtFLC in Arabidopsis ecotypes.},

Flowering is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors, photoreceptors, enzymes and miRNAs. In recent years, several studies gave rise to the hypothesis that this network is also strongly involved in the regulation of other important lifecycle processes ranging from germination and seed development through to fundamental developmental and yield-related traits. In the allopolyploid crop species Brassica napus, (genome AACC), homoeologous copies of flowering time regulatory genes are implicated in major phenological variation within the species, however the extent and control of intraspecific and intergenomic variation among flowering-time regulators is still unclear. To investigate differences among B. napus morphotypes in relation to flowering-time gene variation, we performed targeted deep sequencing of 29 regulatory flowering-time genes in four genetically and phenologically diverse B. napus accessions. The genotype panel included a winter-type oilseed rape, a winter fodder rape, a spring-type oilseed rape (all B. napus ssp. napus) and a swede (B. napus ssp. napobrassica), which show extreme differences in winter-hardiness, vernalization requirement and flowering behavior. A broad range of genetic variation was detected in the targeted genes for the different morphotypes, including non-synonymous SNPs, copy number variation and presence-absence variation. The results suggest that this broad variation in vernalization, clock and signaling genes could be a key driver of morphological differentiation for flowering-related traits in this recent allopolyploid crop species.},

        abstract = {Gene duplication and alternative splicing are important sources of proteomic diversity. Despite research indicating that gene duplication and alternative splicing are negatively correlated, the evolutionary relationship between the two remains unclear. One manner in which alternative splicing and gene duplication may be related is through the process of subfunctionalization, in which an alternatively spliced gene upon duplication divides distinct splice isoforms among the newly generated daughter genes, in this way reducing the number of alternatively spliced transcripts duplicate genes produce. Previously, it has been shown that splice form subfunctionalization will result in duplicate pairs with divergent exon structure when distinct isoforms become fixed in each paralog. However, the effects of exon structure divergence between paralogs have never before been studied on a genome-wide scale. Here, using genomic data from human, mouse, and zebrafish, we demonstrate that gene duplication followed by exon structure divergence between paralogs results in a significant reduction in levels of alternative splicing. In addition, by comparing the exon structure of zebrafish duplicates to the co-orthologous human gene, we have demonstrated that a considerable fraction of exon divergent duplicates maintain the structural signature of splice form subfunctionalization. Furthermore, we find that paralogs with divergent exon structure demonstrate reduced breadth of expression in a variety of tissues when compared to paralogs with identical exon structures and singletons. Taken together, our results are consistent with subfunctionalization partitioning alternatively spliced isoforms among duplicate genes and as such highlight the relationship between gene duplication and alternative splicing.},

If so, there are two consequences: first, both underexpression and overexpression of protein complex subunits should lower fitness, and second, the accuracy of transcriptional co-regulation of subunits should reflect the deleterious consequences of imbalance. Here we show that all these predictions are upheld in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This supports the hypothesis that dominance is a by-product of physiology and metabolism rather than the result of selection to mask the deleterious effects of mutations. Beyond this, single-gene duplication of protein subunits is expected to be harmful, as this, too, leads to imbalance. As then expected, we find that members of large gene families are rarely involved in complexes. The balance hypothesis therefore provides a single theoretical framework for understanding components both of dominance and of gene family size.},

We apply our procedure to seventeen fungal genomes to create a genome-wide catalogue of gene trees that determine precise orthology and paralogy relations across these species. We show that gene duplication and loss is highly constrained by the functional properties and interacting partners of genes. In particular, stress-related genes exhibit many duplications and losses, whereas growth-related genes show selection against such changes. Whole-genome duplication circumvents this constraint and relaxes the dichotomy, resulting in an expanded functional scope of gene duplication. By characterizing the functional fate of duplicate genes we show that duplicated genes rarely diverge with respect to biochemical function, but typically diverge with respect to regulatory control. Surprisingly, paralogous modules of genes rarely arise, even after whole-genome duplication. Rather, gene duplication may drive the modularization of functional networks through specialization, thereby disentangling cellular systems.},

Results from a total of 2177 successful expression assays permitted us to determine the extent of expression evolution accompanying genomic merger of divergent diploid parents, genome doubling, and genomic coevolution in a common nucleus subsequent to polyploid formation. We demonstrate that 40\% of homeologs are transcriptionally biased in at least one stage of cotton development, that genome merger per se has a large effect on relative expression of homeologs, and that the majority of these alterations are caused by cis-regulatory divergence between the diploid progenitors.

New hybrid species might be expected to show patterns of gene expression intermediate to those shown by parental species [1, 2]. “Transcriptomic shock” may also occur, in which gene expression is disrupted; this may be further modified by whole genome duplication (causing allopolyploidy) [3–16]. “Shock” can include instantaneous partitioning of gene expression between parental copies of genes among tissues [16–19]. These effects have not previously been studied at a population level in a natural allopolyploid plant species. Here, we survey tissue-specific expression of 144 duplicated gene pairs derived from different parental species (homeologs) in two natural populations of 40-generation-old allotetraploid Tragopogon miscellus (Asteraceae) plants. We compare these results with patterns of allelic expression in both in vitro “hybrids” and hand-crossed F1 hybrids between the parental diploids T. dubius and T. pratensis, and with patterns of homeolog expression in synthetic (S1) allotetraploids. Partitioning of expression was frequent in natural allopolyploids, but F1 hybrids and S1 allopolyploids showed less partitioning of expression than the natural allopolyploids and the in vitro “hybrids” of diploid parents. Our results suggest that regulation of gene expression is relaxed in a concerted manner upon hybridization, and new patterns of partitioned expression subsequently emerge over the generations following allopolyploidization.},

        abstract = {Recent analysis of complete eukaryotic genome sequences has revealed that gene duplication has been rampant. Moreover, next to a continuous mode of gene duplication, in many eukaryotic organisms the complete genome has been duplicated in their evolutionary past. Such large-scale gene duplication events have been associated with important evolutionary transitions or major leaps in development and adaptive radiations of species. Here, we present an evolutionary model that simulates the duplication dynamics of genes, considering genome-wide duplication events and a continuous mode of gene duplication. Modeling the evolution of the different functional categories of genes assesses the importance of different duplication events for gene families involved in specific functions or processes. By applying our model to the Arabidopsis genome, for which there is compelling evidence for three whole-genome duplications, we show that gene loss is strikingly different for large-scale and small-scale duplication events and highly biased toward certain functional classes. We provide evidence that some categories of genes were almost exclusively expanded through large-scale gene duplication events. In particular, we show that the three whole-genome duplications in Arabidopsis have been directly responsible for {\textgreater}90\% of the increase in transcription factors, signal transducers, and developmental genes in the last 350 million years. Our evolutionary model is widely applicable and can be used to evaluate different assumptions regarding small- or large-scale gene duplication events in eukaryotic genomes.},

Genes retained in duplicate are not distributed evenly among Gene Ontology or Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences functional categories, which indicates a nonrandom process of gene loss. Genes involved in signal transduction and transcription have been preferentially retained, and those involved in DNA repair have been preferentially lost. Although the two members of each gene pair must originally have had identical transcription profiles, less than half of the pairs formed by the most recent polyploidy event still retain significantly correlated profiles. We identified several cases where groups of duplicated gene pairs have diverged in concert, forming two parallel networks, each containing one member of each gene pair. In these cases, the expression of each gene is strongly correlated with the other nonhomologous genes in its network but poorly correlated with its paralog in the other network. We also find that the rate of protein sequence evolution has been significantly asymmetric in {\textgreater}20\% of duplicate pairs. Together, these results suggest that functional diversification of the surviving duplicated genes is a major feature of the long-term evolution of polyploids.},

Reunification of the evolutionarily divergent genomes in allopolyploids creates regulatory incompatibilities that must be reconciled. Here we report genomewide gene expression analysis of Arabidopsis synthetic allotetraploids, using spotted 70-mer oligo-gene microarrays. We detected {\textgreater}15\% transcriptome divergence between the progenitors, and 2105 and 1818 genes were highly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and A. arenosa, respectively. Approximately 5.2\% (1362) and 5.6\% (1469) genes displayed expression divergence from the midparent value (MPV) in two independently derived synthetic allotetraploids, suggesting nonadditive gene regulation following interspecific hybridization. Remarkably, the majority of nonadditively expressed genes in the allotetraploids also display expression changes between the parents, indicating that transcriptome divergence is reconciled during allopolyploid formation. Moreover, {\textgreater}65\% of the nonadditively expressed genes in the allotetraploids are repressed, and {\textgreater}94\% of the repressed genes in the allotetraploids match the genes that are expressed at higher levels in A. thaliana than in A. arenosa, consistent with the silencing of A. thaliana rRNA genes subjected to nucleolar dominance and with overall suppression of the A. thaliana phenotype in the synthetic allotetraploids and natural A. suecica. The nonadditive gene regulation is involved in various biological pathways, and the changes in gene expression are developmentally regulated. In contrast to the small effects of genome doubling on gene regulation in autotetraploids, the combination of two divergent genomes in allotetraploids by interspecific hybridization induces genomewide nonadditive gene regulation, providing a molecular basis for de novo variation and allopolyploid evolution.},

In this study, we explored gene expression patterns in interspecific hybrid F1, and synthetic and natural allopolyploid cotton using RNA-Seq reads from leaf transcriptomes. We determined how the extent and direction of expression level dominance (total level of expression for both homoeologs) and homoeolog expression bias (relative contribution of homoeologs to the transcriptome) changed from hybridization through evolution at the polyploid level and following cotton domestication. Genome-wide expression level dominance was biased toward the A-genome in the diploid hybrid and natural allopolyploids, whereas the direction was reversed in the synthetic allopolyploid. This biased expression level dominance was mainly caused by up- or downregulation of the homoeolog from the ‘non-dominant’ parent. Extensive alterations in homoeolog expression bias and expression level dominance accompany the initial merger of two diverged diploid genomes, suggesting a combination of regulatory (cis or trans) and epigenetic interactions that may arise and propagate through the transcriptome network. The extent of homoeolog expression bias and expression level dominance increases over time, from genome merger through evolution at the polyploid level. Higher rates of transgressive and novel gene expression patterns as well as homoeolog silencing were observed in natural allopolyploids than in F1 hybrid and synthetic allopolyploid cottons. These observations suggest that natural selection reconciles the regulatory mismatches caused by initial genomic merger, while new gene expression conditions are generated for evaluation by selection.},

With the goal of providing a framework for the analysis of Arabidopsis meristems at the cellular level, we performed a detailed morphometric study of actively growing inflorescence apices of the Landsberg erecta and Wassilewskija ecotypes. For this purpose, cell size, spatial distribution of mitotic cells, and the mitotic index were determined in a series of optical sections made with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The results allowed us to identify zones within the inflorescence SAM with different cell proliferation rates. In particular, we were able to define a central area that was four to six cells wide and had a low mitotic index. We used this technique to compare the meristem of the wild type with the enlarged meristems of two mutants, clavata3-1 (clv3-1) and mgoun2 (mgo2). One of the proposed functions of the CLV genes is to limit cell division rates in the center of the meristem. Our data allowed us to reject this hypothesis, because the mitotic index was reduced in the inflorescence meristem of the clv3-1 mutant. We also observed a large zone of slowly dividing cells in meristems of clv3-1 seedlings. This zone was not detectable in the wild type. These results suggest that the central area is increased in size in the mutant meristem, which is in line with the hypothesis that the CLV3 gene is necessary for the transition of cells from the central to the peripheral zone. Genetic and microscopic analyses suggest that mgo2 is impaired in the production of primordia, and we previously proposed that the increased size of the mgo2 meristem could be due to an accumulation of cells at the periphery. Our morphometric analysis showed that mgo2 meristems, in contrast to those of clv3-1, have an enlarged periphery with high cell proliferation rates. This confirms that clv3-1 and mgo2 lead to meristem overgrowth by affecting different aspects of meristem function.},

Plant development is characterized by precise control of gene regulation, leading to the correct spatial and temporal tissue patterning. We have characterized the Arabidopsis jabba-1D (jba-1D) mutant, which displays multiple enlarged shoot meristems, radialized leaves, reduced gynoecia and vascular defects. The jba-1D meristem phenotypes require WUSCHEL (WUS) activity, and correlate with a dramatic increase in WUS expression levels. We demonstrate that the jba-1D phenotypes are caused by over-expression of miR166g, and require the activity of the RNase III helicase DCL1. miR166g over-expression in jba-1D plants affects the transcripts of several class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (AtHD-ZIP) family target genes. The expression of PHABULOSA (PHB), PHAVOLUTA (PHV) and CORONA (CNA) is significantly reduced in a jba-1D background, while REVOLUTA (REV) expression is elevated and ATHB8 is unchanged. In addition, we show that miR166 has a dynamic expression pattern in wild-type and jba-1D embryos. Our analysis demonstrates an indirect role for miRNAs in controlling meristem formation via regulation of WUS expression, and reveals complex regulation of the class III AtHD-ZIP gene family.},

	abstract = {Author Summary All the organs of plant shoots are derived from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), a pool of plant stem cells that are both organogenic and self-sustaining. These dual SAM functions take place in distinct yet adjacent meristematic domains; leaves are derived from the peripheral zone (PZ) of the SAM whereas cells lost during organogenesis are replenished from the central zone (CZ). Deciphering the global patterns of differential gene expression within these discrete SAM functional domains is integral toward understanding the molecular-signaling networks that regulate plant development. We utilized laser-microdissection technology to isolate tissues from the SAM crown and center (SAM-proper) and from initiating leaves (P0/P1) at the SAM periphery for use in microarray comparisons of gene expression within these SAM functional domains. Nine hundred and sixty-two maize genes were differentially expressed, confirming that the distinct functions of these meristematic domains involve widespread differences in gene expression. Genes involved in cell division, cell wall biosynthesis, chromatin structure, and RNA binding are especially upregulated in initiating leaves, whereas genes regulating protein stability and DNA repair are upregulated in the SAM proper. Mutations in a D-cyclin gene that was upregulated in the P0/P1 render narrow-leafed mutant plants with defective stomatal patterning, providing functional genetic data for a previously uncharacterized maize gene.},

	abstract = {Altered expression of Brassica napus (Bn) SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) affects the morphology and behaviour of microspore-derived embryos (MDEs). While down-regulation of BnSTM repressed the formation of the shoot meristem (SAM) and reduced the number of Brassica MDEs able to regenerate viable plants at germination, over-expression of BnSTM enhanced the structure of the SAM and improved regeneration frequency. Within dissected SAMs, the induction of BnSTM up-regulated the expression of many transcription factors (TFs) some of which directly involved in the formation of the meristem, i.e. CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 and WUSCHEL, and regulatory components of the antioxidant response, hormone signalling, and cell wall synthesis and modification. Opposite expression patterns for some of these genes were observed in the SAMs of MDEs down-regulating BnSTM. Altered expression of BnSTM affected transcription of cell wall and lignin biosynthetic genes. The expression of PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA LYASE2, CINNAMATE 4-4HYDROXYLASE, and CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE were repressed in SAMs over-expressing BnSTM. Since lignin formation is a feature of irreversible cell differentiation, these results suggest that one way in which BnSTM promotes indeterminate cell fate may be by preventing the expression of components of biochemical pathways involved in the accumulation of lignin in the meristematic cells. Overall, these studies provide evidence for a novel function of BnSTM in enhancing the quality of in vitro produced meristems, and propose that this gene can be used as a potential target to improve regeneration of cultured embryos.},

The B. rapa genome sequence scaffolds required splitting and re-ordering to match the expected genome organisation based on a high density SNP linkage map, but the B. oleracea assembly was used unchanged. The resulting B. rapa (A genome) pseudomolecules contained 47,656 ordered CDS models and the B. oleracea (C genome) pseudomolecules contained 54,766 ordered CDS models. Interpolation of B. napus CDS models not already represented by orthologues resulted in 52,790 and 63,308 ordered CDS models in the A and C pan-transcriptomes, an increase of 13,676 overall. Comparison of the organisation of this resource with publicly available genome sequences for B. napus showed excellent consistency for the B. napus Darmor-bzh resource, but more breakdown of collinearity for the B. napus ZS11 resource. CDS datasets comprising the pan-transcriptomes are available with this article (B. rapa) or from public repositories (B. oleracea and B. napus).},

Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other high-throughput technologies.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and {\textasciitilde}1 h of hands-on time.},

In addition to de novo spliced alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes.

GAZE uses a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the highest scoring gene structure according to the model and posterior probabilities that each input feature is part of a gene. A novel pruning strategy ensures that the algorithm has a run-time effectively linear in sequence length. To demonstrate the flexibility of our system in the incorporation of additional evidence into the gene prediction process, we show how it can be used to both represent nonstandard gene structures (in the form oftrans-spliced genes in Caenorhabditis elegans), and make use of similarity information (in the form of Expressed Sequence Tag alignments), while requiring no change to the underlying software.

	abstract = {We characterized the distribution of AGAMOUS (AG) RNA during early flower development in Arabidopsis. Mutations in this homeotic gene cause the transformation of stamens to petals in floral whorl 3 and of carpels to another ag flower in floral whorl 4. We found that AG RNA is present in the stamen and carpel primordia but is undetectable in sepal and petal primordia throughout early wild-type flower development, consistent with the mutant phenotype. We also analyzed the distribution of AG RNA in apetela2 (ap2) mutant flowers. AP2 is a floral homeotic gene that is necessary for the normal development of sepals and petals in floral whorls 1 and 2. In ap2 mutant flowers, AG RNA is present in the organ primordia of all floral whorls. These observations show that the expression patterns of the Arabidopsis floral homeotic genes are in part established by regulatory interactions between these genes.},

Later in development, AP1 RNA is excluded from cells that will give rise to the two inner whorls of organs. Here we show that AP1 expression is under the control of two negative regulators: the meristem identity gene TERMINAL FLOWER represses AP1 RNA accumulation in the inflorescence meristem, and the organ identity gene AGAMOUS prevents AP1 RNA accumulation in the two inner whorls of wild-type flowers.

	abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana environmental and endogenous cues promote flowering by activating expression of a small number of integrator genes. The MADS box transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a critical inhibitor of flowering that directly represses transcription of these genes. However, we show by genetic analysis that the effect of SVP cannot be fully explained by repressing known floral integrator genes. To identify additional SVP functions, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptome data and show that GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE 2, which encodes an enzyme required for biosynthesis of the growth regulator gibberellin (GA), is upregulated in svp mutants. GA is known to promote flowering, and we find that svp mutants contain elevated levels of GA that correlate with GA-related phenotypes such as early flowering and organ elongation. The ga20ox2 mutation suppresses the elevated GA levels and partially suppresses the growth and early flowering phenotypes of svp mutants. In wild-type plants, SVP expression in the shoot apical meristem falls when plants are exposed to photoperiods that induce flowering, and this correlates with increased expression of GA20ox2. Mutations that impair the photoperiodic flowering pathway prevent this downregulation of SVP and the strong increase in expression of GA20ox2. We conclude that SVP delays flowering by repressing GA biosynthesis as well as integrator gene expression and that, in response to inductive photoperiods, repression of SVP contributes to the rise in GA at the shoot apex, promoting rapid induction of flowering.},

To study the mechanism of cold-induced growth retardation, we exposed maize B73 seedlings to low night temperature (25°C /4°C, day/night) from germination until the completion of leaf 4 expansion. This treatment resulted in a 20\% reduction in final leaf size compared to control conditions (25°C/18°C, day/night). A kinematic analysis of leaf growth rates in control and cold-treated leaves during daytime showed that cold nights affected both cell cycle time (+65\%) and cell production (−22\%). In contrast, the size of mature epidermal cells was unaffected. To analyze the effect on cell cycle progression at the molecular level, we identified through a bioinformatics approach a set of 43 cell cycle genes and analyzed their expression in proliferating, expanding, and mature cells of leaves exposed to either control or cold nights. This analysis showed that: (1) the majority of cell cycle genes had a consistent proliferation-specific expression pattern; and (2) the increased cell cycle time in the basal meristem of leaves exposed to cold nights was associated with differential expression of cell cycle inhibitors and with the concomitant down-regulation of positive regulators of cell division.},

The plant hormones ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) play a central role in the regulation of plant immune responses. In addition, other plant hormones, such as auxins, abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids, that have been thoroughly described to regulate plant development and growth, have recently emerged as key regulators of plant immunity. Plant hormones interact in complex networks to balance the response to developmental and environmental cues and thus limiting defense-associated fitness costs. The molecular mechanisms that govern these hormonal networks are largely unknown. Moreover, hormone signaling pathways are targeted by pathogens to disturb and evade plant defense responses. In this review, we address novel insights on the regulatory roles of the ABA, SA, and auxin in plant resistance to pathogens and we describe the complex interactions among their signal transduction pathways. The strategies developed by pathogens to evade hormone-mediated defensive responses are also described. Based on these data we discuss how hormone signaling could be manipulated to improve the resistance of crops to pathogens.},

The function of NPR3 protein during early flower development was revealed through a detailed molecular-genetic analysis including promoter transcriptional fusion analysis, phenotype characterization of npr3-3 mutants/overexpressors, and whole-plant fitness analysis. The physical interaction between NPR3 and NPR1/TGA2 was explored using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis in onion epidermal cells. Here, we show that NPR3 expression was strongest in the petals and sepals of developing flowers and declined after flower opening. Consistently with this observation, an npr3 knockout mutant displayed enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae infection of immature flowers, but not leaves. Developing npr3 flowers exhibited increased levels of basal and induced PR1 transcript accumulation. However, the npr3 mutant showed lower fitness compared to Col-0 in the absence of pathogen. Moreover, NPR3 was shown to interact with NPR1 and TGA2 in vivo. Our data suggest that NPR3 is a negative regulator of defense responses during early flower development and it may function through the association with both NPR1 and TGA2.},

Despite the important role of temperature on plant development, the underlying pathways are unknown. It has previously been shown that thermal acceleration of flowering is dependent on the florigen, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). How this occurs is, however, not understood, because the major pathway known to upregulate FT, the photoperiod pathway, is not required for thermal acceleration of flowering. Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism by which increasing temperature causes the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) to activate FT. Our findings provide a new understanding of how plants control their timing of reproduction in response to temperature. Flowering time is an important trait in crops as well as affecting the life cycles of pollinator species.

This process has been shown to require conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) components including the Su(z)12 homologue, VRN2, and two plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins, VRN5 and VIN3. However, the sequence of events leading to FLC repression was unclear. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, VRN2 associates throughout the FLC locus independently of cold. The vernalization-induced silencing is triggered by the cold-dependent association of the PHD finger protein VRN5 to a specific domain in FLC intron 1, and this association is dependent on the cold-induced PHD protein VIN3. In plants returned to warm conditions, VRN5 distribution changes, and it associates more broadly over FLC, coincident with significant increases in H3K27me3. Biochemical purification of a VRN5 complex showed that during prolonged cold a PHD-PRC2 complex forms composed of core PRC2 components (VRN2, SWINGER [an E(Z) HMTase homologue], FIE [an ESC homologue], MSI1 [p55 homologue]), and three related PHD finger proteins, VRN5, VIN3, and VEL1. The PHD-PRC2 activity increases H3K27me3 throughout the locus to levels sufficient for stable silencing. Arabidopsis PHD-PRC2 thus seems to act similarly to Pcl-PRC2 of Drosophila and PHF1-PRC2 of mammals. These data show FLC silencing involves changed composition and dynamic redistribution of Polycomb complexes at different stages of the vernalization process, a mechanism with greater parallels to Polycomb silencing of certain mammalian loci than the classic Drosophila Polycomb targets.},

        abstract = {We describe the effects of four recessive homeotic mutations that specifically disrupt the development of flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of the recessive mutations affects the outcome of organ development, but not the location of organ primordia. Homeotic transformations observed are as follows. In agamous-1, stamens to petals; in apetala2-1, sepals to leaves and petals to staminoid petals; in apetala3-1, petals to sepals and stamens to carpels; in pistillata-1, petals to sepals. In addition, two of these mutations (ap2-1 and pi-1) result in loss of organs, and ag-1 causes the cells that would ordinarily form the gynoecium to differentiate as a flower. Two of the mutations are temperature-sensitive. Temperature shift experiments indicate that the wild-type AP2 gene product acts at the time of primordium initiation; the AP3 product is active later. It seems that the wild-type alleles of these four genes allow cells to determine their place in the developing flower and thus to differentiate appropriately. We propose that these genes may be involved in setting up or responding to concentric, overlapping fields within the flower primordium.},

        abstract = {APETALA2 (AP2) plays a central role in the establishment of the floral meristem, the specification of floral organ identity, and the regulation of floral homeotic gene expression in Arabidopsis. We show here that in addition to its functions during flower development, AP2 activity is also required during seed development. We isolated the AP2 gene and found that it encodes a putative nuclear protein that is distinguished by an essential 68-amino acid repeated motif, the AP2 domain. Consistent with its genetic functions, we determined that AP2 is expressed at the RNA level in all four types of floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--and in developing ovules. Thus, AP2 gene transcription does not appear to be spatially restricted by the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS as predicted by previous studies. We also found that AP2 is expressed at the RNA level in the inflorescence meristem and in nonfloral organs, including leaf and stem. Taken together, our results suggest that AP2 represents a new class of plant regulatory proteins that may play a general role in the control of Arabidopsis development.
Seeds are studied to understand dispersal and establishment of the next generation, as units of agricultural yield, and for other important reasons. Thus, elucidating the genetic architecture of seed size and shape traits will benefit basic and applied plant biology research. This study sought quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling the size and shape of Arabidopsis thaliana seeds by computational analysis of seed phenotypes in recombinant inbred lines derived from the small-seeded Landsberg erecta × large-seeded Cape Verde Islands accessions. On the order of 103 seeds from each recombinant inbred line were automatically measured with flatbed photo scanners and custom image analysis software. The eight significant QTL affecting seed area explained 63\% of the variation, and overlapped with five of the six major-axis (length) QTL and three of the five minor-axis (width) QTL, which accounted for 57\% and 38\% of the variation in those traits, respectively. Because the Arabidopsis seed is exalbuminous, lacking an endosperm at maturity, the results are relatable to embryo length and width. The Cvi allele generally had a positive effect of 2.6–4.0\%. Analysis of variance showed heritability of the three traits ranged between 60\% and 73\%. Repeating the experiment with 2.2 million seeds from a separate harvest of the RIL population and approximately 0.5 million seeds from 92 near-isogenic lines confirmed the aforementioned results. Structured for download are files containing phenotype measurements, all sets of seed images, and the seed trait measuring tool.},

Like many plants, Arabidopsis thaliana integrates environmental and endogenous signals to control the timing of reproduction. To study the underlying regulatory logic of the floral transition, we used a combination of modeling and experiments to define a core gene regulatory network. We show that FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) act through FD and FD PARALOG to regulate the transition. The major floral meristem identity gene LEAFY (LFY) directly activates FD, creating a positive feedback loop. This network predicts flowering behavior for different genotypes and displays key properties of the floral transition, such as signal integration and irreversibility. Furthermore, modeling suggests that the control of TFL1 is important to flexibly counterbalance incoming FT signals, allowing a pool of undifferentiated cells to be maintained despite strong differentiation signals in nearby cells. This regulatory system requires TFL1 expression to rise in proportion to the strength of the floral inductive signal. In this network, low initial levels of LFY or TFL1 expression are sufficient to tip the system into either a stable flowering or vegetative state upon floral induction.},

        abstract = {Citrus trees have a long juvenile phase that delays their reproductive development by between 6 and 20 years, depending on the species. With the aim of accelerating their flowering time, we transformed juvenile citrus seedlings to constitutively express the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) or APETALA1 (AP1) genes, which promote flower initiation in Arabidopsis. Both types of transgenic citrus produced fertile flowers and fruits as early as the first year, notably through a mechanism involving an appreciable shortening of their juvenile phase. Furthermore, expression of AP1 was as efficient as LFY in the initiation of flowers, and did not produce any severe developmental abnormality. Both types of transgenic trees flowered in consecutive years, and their flowering response was under environmental control. In addition, zygotic and nucellar derived transgenic seedlings had a very short juvenile phase and flowered in their first spring, demonstrating the stability and inheritance of this trait. These results open new possibilities for domestication, genetic improvement, and experimental research in citrus and other woody species.},

        abstract = {During the initial stages of flower development, floral meristems increase in size without the formation of floral organs. When a critical meristem size is reached, the floral meristem begins to develop the floral organs. The first stages of flower development are characterized by the expression of genes such as APETALA 1 (AP1), CAULIFLOWER (CAL), AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). We have shown that AP1, AGL24 and SVP act redundantly to control the identity of the floral meristem and to repress expression of class B, C and E genes. Recently, it was shown that class E gene repression was direct and established by two independent pathways. We show here that repression of class B and C genes is also directly established by a co-repressor complex that comprises LEUNIG (LUG), SEUSS (SEU) and the MADS box dimers AP1–AGL24 and AP1–SVP. Furthermore, we show that the distantly related SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) MADS box gene can complement for the loss of AGL24 and SVP activity; however, under normal conditions, this transcription factor does not play a role during the early stages of flower development.},

        abstract = {In angiosperms, after the floral transition, the inflorescence meristem produces floral meristems (FMs). Determinate growth of FMs produces flowers of a particular size and form. This determinate growth requires specification of floral organs and termination of stem-cell divisions. Establishment of the FM and specification of outer whorl organs (sepals and petals) requires the floral homeotic gene APETALA1 (AP1). To determine FM identity, AP1 also prevents the formation of flowers in the axils of sepals. The mechanisms underlying AP1 function in the floral transition and in floral organ patterning have been studied extensively, but how AP1 terminates sepal axil stem-cell activities to suppress axillary secondary flower formation remains unclear. Here we show that AP1 regulates cytokinin levels by directly suppressing the cytokinin biosynthetic gene LONELY GUY1 and activating the cytokinin degradation gene CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE3. Restoring the expression of these genes to wild-type levels in AP1-expressing cells or suppressing cytokinin signaling inhibits indeterminate inflorescence meristem activity caused by ap1 mutation. We conclude that suppression of cytokinin biosynthesis and activation of cytokinin degradation mediates AP1 function in establishing determinate FM. A deeper understanding of axil-lateral meristem activity provides crucial information for enhancing yield by engineering crops that produce more elaborated racemes.},

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AP1 function, we identified its target genes during floral initiation using a combination of gene expression profiling and genome-wide binding studies. Many of its targets encode transcriptional regulators, including known floral repressors. The latter genes are down-regulated by AP1, suggesting that it initiates floral development by abrogating the inhibitory effects of these genes. Although AP1 acts predominantly as a transcriptional repressor during the earliest stages of flower development, at more advanced stages it also activates regulatory genes required for floral organ formation, indicating a dynamic mode of action. Our results further imply that AP1 orchestrates floral initiation by integrating growth, patterning, and hormonal pathways.

In addition to later flowering the number of rosette and cauline leaves is proportionally higher in all mutants, although the correlation coefficient between the two parameters is not the same for all genotypes. Forty-two independently induced mutants were found to represent mutations at 11 loci. The mutations were either recessive, intermediate (co locus) or almost completely dominant (fwa locus). The loci are located at distinct positions on four of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes. Recombinants carrying mutations at different loci flower later than or as late as the later parental mutant. This distinction led to the assignment of eight of the loci to three epistatic groups. In wild type, vernalization promotes flowering to a small extent. For mutants at the loci fca, fve, fy and fpa, vernalization has a large effect both under LD and short day (SD) conditions, whereas co, gi, fd and fwa mutants are almost completely insensitive to this treatment. SD induces later flowering except for mutants at the co and gi loci, which flower with the same number of leaves under LD and SD conditions. This differential response of the mutants to environmental factors and their subdivision into epistatic groups is discussed in relation to a causal model for floral initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

Comparison of such homologues allows insight into how morphological traits evolve. However, it is often unclear which changes are key to determining new functions. To address these ideas, we have studied a system where two homologues have evolved clear and opposite functions in controlling a major developmental switch. In plants, flowering is a major developmental transition that is critical to reproductive success. Arabidopsis phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein homologues TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are key controllers of flowering, determining when and where flowers are made, but as opposing functions: TFL1 is a repressor, FT is an activator. We have uncovered a striking molecular basis for how these homologous proteins have diverged. Although {\textless}60\% identical, we have shown that swapping a single amino acid is sufficient to convert TFL1 to FT function and vice versa. Therefore, these key residues may have strongly contributed to the selection of these important functions over plant evolution. Further, our results suggest that TFL1 and FT are highly conserved in biochemical function and that they act as repressors or activators of flowering through discrimination of structurally related interactors by a single residue.},

Transcripts of the Arabidopsis thaliana flowering-promoting gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are present in leaf tissue but can also promote flowering when artificially introduced into the meristem. FT may normally act in the leaf and/or the meristem, initiating or constituting a mobile flower-promoting signal. We studied FT-dependent events in the rosette leaf, some of which might precede or mimic events in the meristem and its primordia. We show FT-dependent transcript accumulation of the MADS box transcription factors FRUITFULL (FUL) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) in leaves. Abnormally high levels of FT further increase the expression of these genes, leading to morphological changes in the leaves. Loss of the flowering-time gene FD, as well as environmental conditions that delay flowering, reduce FT's effect on leaves via reduced activation of its targets. FUL, SEP3, and APETALA1 accumulation in the meristem is associated with and contributes to the transition to flowering. We propose that FT functions through partner-dependent transcriptional activation of these and as-yet-unknown genes and that this occurs at several sites. Organ fate may depend on both degree of activation and the developmental stage reached by the organ before activation occurs.},

FT and SOC1 have been proposed to act in parallel pathways downstream of CO based on genetic analysis using weak ft alleles, since ft soc1 double mutants showed an additive effect in suppressing the early flowering of CO overexpressor plants. However, this genetic analysis was inconsistent with the sequential induction pattern of FT and SOC1 found in inducible CO overexpressor plants. Hence, to identify genetic interactions of CO, FT, and SOC1, we carried out genetic and expression analyses with a newly isolated T-DNA allele of FT, ft-10. We found that ft-10 almost completely suppressed the early flowering phenotype of CO overexpressor plants, whereas soc1-2 partially suppressed the phenotype, suggesting that FT is the major output of CO. Expression of SOC1 was altered in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of FT, whereas expression of FT remained unchanged in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of SOC1, suggesting that FT positively regulates SOC1 to promote flowering. In addition, inactivation of FT caused down-regulation of SOC1 even in plants overexpressing CO, indicating that FT is required for SOC1 induction by CO. Taken together, these data suggest that CO activates SOC1 through FT to promote flowering in Arabidopsis.},

The identity of the long-distance signal has yet to be determined. In Arabidopsis, activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcription in leaf vascular tissue (phloem) induces flowering. We found that FT messenger RNA is required only transiently in the leaf. In addition, FT fusion proteins expressed specifically in phloem cells move to the apex and move long distances between grafted plants. Finally, we provide evidence that FT does not activate an intermediate messenger in leaves. We conclude that FT protein acts as a long-distance signal that induces Arabidopsis flowering.

Plants are sessile organisms and must respond to changes in environmental conditions. Flowering time is a key developmental switch that is affected by both day length and temperature. Environmental cues are sensed by the leaves while the responses occur at the apex, requiring long-range communication within the plant. For many years it has been known that leaves exposed to light can trigger the floral transition of a darkened shoot, and grafting experiments demonstrated that the floral stimulus travels long distances [1]. This mobile signal was later termed “florigen,” but its nature has been unclear. The gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a major output of both the photoperiod and the vernalization pathways controlling the floral transition [2–4]. FT protein acts at the shoot apex of the plant in concert with a transcription factor, FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) [5, 6]. A fundamental question is how FT transcription in the leaves leads to active FT protein at the apex. We have uncoupled FT protein movement from its biological function to show that FT protein is the mobile signal that travels from the leaves to the apex. To our knowledge, FT is the only known protein that serves as a long-range developmental signal in plants.},

	abstract = {Summary
Several endogenous and environmental factors need to be integrated to time the onset of flowering [1–3]. Genetic and molecular analyses, primarily in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, have shown that CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) play central roles in photoperiod-dependent flowering [4–13]. The overall picture is that CO acts in the phloem companion cells of leaves and that its main effect is to induce FT mRNA in these cells [11, 12, 14–19]. Surprisingly, FT, a small globular protein of 20 kDa, interacts at the shoot apex with the bZIP transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) to induce downstream targets [17, 18]. Given that green fluorescent protein (GFP), which as a monomer is 27 kDa, can be easily exported to sink tissue including flowers when expressed in phloem companion cells, the latter finding strongly implied that FT protein is the mobile floral-inductive signal [17–19]. In agreement with this hypothesis, an FT-GFP fusion, just like GFP, can be exported from the phloem of both rice and Arabidopsis[20, 21]. It has been unknown, however, whether mobile FT protein is sufficient for transmitting the flowering signal. Here we show that FT mRNA is required in phloem companion cells where it acts partially redundant with its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) to induce flowering. Furthermore, we have devised a method that uncouples FT mRNA and protein effects in vivo. We demonstrate that export of FT protein from phloem companion cells is sufficient to induce flowering.},

Some of the key determinants are the timing of the floral transition induced by a systemic flowering signal (florigen) and the branching pattern regulated by key factors such as BRANCHED1 (BRC1). Here, we report that BRC1 interacts with the florigen proteins FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) but not with TERMINAL FLOWER1, a floral repressor. FT protein induced in leaves moves into the subtended bud, suggesting that FT protein also plays a role in promotion of the floral transition in the axillary meristem (AM). The brc1-2 mutant shows an earlier floral transition in the axillary shoots compared with the wild type, suggesting that BRC1 plays a role in delaying the floral transition of the AMs. Genetic and gene expression analyses suggest that BRC1 interferes with florigen (FT and TSF) function in the AMs. Consistent with this, BRC1 ectopically expressed in the shoot apical meristem delays the floral transition in the main shoot. These results taken together suggest that BRC1 protein interacts with FT and TSF proteins and modulates florigen activity in the axillary buds to prevent premature floral transition of the AMs.},

Flower development at the shoot apex is initiated in response to environmental cues. Day length is one of the most important of these and is perceived in the leaves. A systemic signal, called the floral stimulus or florigen, is then transmitted from the leaves through the phloem and induces floral development at the shoot apex. Genetic analysis in Arabidopsis identified a pathway of genes required for the initiation of flowering in response to day length. The nuclear zinc-finger protein CONSTANS (CO) plays a central role in this pathway, and in response to long days activates the transcription of FT, which encodes a RAF-kinase-inhibitor-like protein. We show using grafting approaches that CO acts non-cell autonomously to trigger flowering. Although CO is expressed widely, its misexpression from phloem-specific promoters, but not from meristem-specific promoters, is sufficient to induce early flowering and complement the co mutation. The mechanism by which CO triggers flowering from the phloem involves the cell-autonomous activation of FT expression. Genetic approaches indicate that CO activates flowering through both FT-dependent and FT-independent processes, whereas FT acts both in the phloem and the meristem to trigger flowering. We propose that, partly through the activation of FT, CO regulates the synthesis or transport of a systemic flowering signal, thereby positioning this signal within the established hierarchy of regulatory proteins that controls flowering.},

It is adapted to different environments by modification of flowering time and requirement for cold. A broad variation exists from very early-flowering spring-type to late-flowering winter cultivars which only flower after exposure to an extended cold period. B. napus is an allopolyploid species which resulted from the hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the PEBP-domain genes FLOWERING LOCUS-T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER-1 (TFL1) are important integrators of different flowering pathways. Six FT and four TFL1 paralogs have been identified in B. napus. However, their role in flowering time control is unknown. We identified EMS mutants of the B. napus winter-type inbreed line Express 617. In total, 103 mutant alleles have been determined for BnC6FTb, BnC6FTa, and BnTFL1-2 paralogs. We chose three non-sense and 15 missense mutant lines (M3) which were grown in the greenhouse. Although only two out of 6 FT paralogs were mutated, 6 out of 8 BnC6FTb mutant lines flowered later as the control, whereas all five BnC6FTa mutant lines started flowering as the non-mutated parent. Mutations within the BnTFL1-2 paralog had no large effects on flowering time but on yield components. F1 hybrids between BnTFL1-2 mutants and non-mutated parents had increased seed number per pod and total seeds per plant suggesting that heterozygous mutations in a TFL1 paralog may impact heterosis in rapeseed. We demonstrate that single point-mutations in BnFT and BnTFL1 paralogs have effects on flowering time despite the redundancy of the rapeseed genome. Moreover, our results suggest pleiotropic effects of BnTFL1 paralogs beyond the regulation of flowering time.},

Here we investigated the photoperiod responsiveness of summer annual-types of Brassica napus (rapeseed, canola). A population of 131 doubled haploid lines derived from a cross between European and Australian parents was evaluated for days to flowering, thermal time to flowering (measured in degree-days) and the number of leaf nodes at flowering in a compact and efficient glasshouse-based experiment with replicated short and long day treatments. All three traits were under strong genetic control with heritability estimates ranging from 0.85–0.93. There was a very strong photoperiod effect with flowering in the population accelerated by 765 degree-days in the long day versus short day treatments. However, there was a strong genetic correlation of line effects (0.91) between the long and short day treatments and relatively low genotype x treatment interaction indicating that photoperiod had a similar effect across the population. Bivariate analysis of thermal time to flowering in short and long days revealed three main effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that accounted for 57.7\% of the variation in the population and no significant interaction QTLs. These results provided insight into the contrasting adaptations of Australian and European varieties. Both parents responded to photoperiod and their alleles shifted the population to earlier flowering under long days. In addition, segregation of QTLs in the population caused wide transgressive segregation in thermal time to flowering. Potential candidate flowering time homologues located near QTLs were identified with the aid of the Brassica rapa reference genome sequence. We discuss how these results will help to guide the breeding of summer annual types of B. napus adapted to new and changing environments.},

        abstract = {Vernalization is required to induce flowering in cabbage (Brassica oleracea var Capitata L.). Since FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) was identified as a major repressor of flowering in the vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two homologs of AtFLC, BoFLC3-2 and BoFLC4-1, were isolated from cabbage to investigate the molecular mechanism of vernalization in cabbage flowering. In addition to the sequence homology, the genomic organization of cabbage FLC is similar to that of AtFLC, except that BoFLC has a relatively smaller intron 1 compared to that of AtFLC. A vernalization-mediated decrease in FLC transcript level was correlated with an increase in FT transcript level in the apex of cabbage. This observation is in agreement with the down-regulation of FT by FLC in Arabidopsis. Yet, unlike that in Arabidopsis, the accumulation of cabbage FLC transcript decreased after cold treatment of leafy plants but not imbibed seeds, which is consistent with the promotion of cabbage flowering by vernalizing adult plants rather than seeds. To further dissect the different regulation of FLC expression between seed-vernalization-responsive species (e.g. Arabidopsis) and plant-vernalization-responsive species (e.g. cabbage), the pBoFLC4-1∷BoFLC4-1∷GUS construct was introduced into Arabidopsis to examine its vernalization response. Down-regulation of the BoFLC4-1∷GUS construct by seed vernalization was unstable and incomplete; in addition, the expression of BoFLC4-1∷GUS was not suppressed by vernalization of transgenic rosette-stage Arabidopsis plants. We propose a hypothesis to illustrate the distinct mechanism by which vernalization regulates the expression of FLC in cabbage and Arabidopsis.},

So far, several genes have been identified that are involved in flowering time control. AGL20 (AGAMOUSLIKE20) is a MADS domain gene from Arabidopsis that is activated in shoot apical meristems during the transition to flowering. By transposon tagging we have identified late flowering agl20 mutants, showing that AGL20 is involved in flowering time control. In previously described late flowering mutants of the long-day and constitutive pathways of floral induction the expression of AGL20 is down-regulated, demonstrating that AGL20 acts downstream to the mutated genes. Moreover, we can show that AGL20 is also regulated by the gibberellin (GA) pathway, indicating that AGL20 integrates signals of different pathways of floral induction and might be a central component for the induction of flowering. In addition, the constitutive expression of AGL20 in Arabidopsis is sufficient for photoperiod independent flowering and the over-expression of the orthologous gene from mustard, MADSA, in the classical short-day tobacco Maryland Mammoth bypasses the strict photoperiodic control of flowering.},

Genes required for CO to promote flowering were identified by screening for mutations that suppress the effect of 35S::CO. Four mutations were identified that partially suppressed the early-flowering phenotype caused by 35S::CO. One of these mutations, suppressor of overexpression of CO 1 (soc1), defines a new locus, demonstrating that the mutagenesis approach is effective in identifying novel flowering-time mutations. The other three suppressor mutations are allelic with previously described mutations that cause late flowering. Two of them are alleles of ft, indicating that FT is required for CO to promote early flowering and most likely acts after CO in the hierarchy of flowering-time genes. The fourth suppressor mutation is an allele of fwa, and fwa soc1 35S::CO plants flowered at approximately the same time as co mutants, suggesting that a combination of fwa and soc1 abolishes the promotion of flowering by CO. Besides delaying flowering, fwa acted synergistically with 35S::CO to repress floral development after bolting. The latter phenotype was not shown by any of the progenitors and was most probably caused by a reduction in the function of LEAFY. These genetic interactions suggest models for how CO, FWA, FT, and SOC1 interact during the transition to flowering.},

We show that in transgenic plants overexpressing CO and FLC, these proteins regulate flowering time antagonistically and FLC blocks transcriptional activation of SOC1 by CO. A series of SOC1::GUS reporter genes identified a 351 bp promoter sequence that mediates activation by CO and repression by FLC. A CArG box (MADS‐domain protein binding element) within this sequence was recognized specifically by FLC in vitro and mediated repression by FLC in vivo, suggesting that FLC binds directly to the SOC1 promoter. We propose that CO is recruited to a separate promoter element by a DNA‐binding factor and that activation by CO is impaired when FLC is bound to an adjacent CArG motif.},

Here, we present evidences that SOC1 also integrates signaling from the GA-dependent pathway, a major flowering pathway under non-inductive short days. Under short days, the flowering time of GA-biosynthetic and -signaling mutants was well correlated with the level of SOC1 expression; overexpression of SOC1 rescued the non-flowering phenotype of ga1-3, and the soc1 null mutant showed reduced sensitivity to GA for flowering. In addition, we show that vernalization-induced repression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), an upstream negative regulator of SOC1, is not sufficient to activate SOC1; positive factors are also required. Under short days, the GA pathway provides a positive factor for SOC1 activation. In contrast to SOC1, the GA pathway does not regulate expression of other flowering integrators FLC and FT. Our results explain why the GA pathway has a strong effect on flowering under short days and how vernalization and GA interact at the molecular level.},

Flowering of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana is controlled by several signaling pathways, which converge on a small set of genes that function as pathway integrators. We have analyzed the genomic response to one type of floral inductive signal, photoperiod, to dissect the function of several genes transducing this stimulus, including CONSTANS, thought to be the major output of the photoperiod pathway. Comparing the effects of CONSTANS with those of FLOWERING LOCUS T, which integrates inputs from CONSTANS and other floral inductive pathways, we find that expression profiles of shoot apices from plants with mutations in either gene are very similar. In contrast, a mutation in LEAFY, which also acts downstream of CONSTANS, has much more limited effects. Another pathway integrator, SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1, is responsive to acute induction by photoperiod even in the presence of the floral repressor encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS C. We have discovered a large group of potential floral repressors that are down-regulated upon photoperiodic induction. These include two AP2 domain-encoding genes that can repress flowering. The two paralogous genes, SCHLAFMÜTZE and SCHNARCHZAPFEN, share a signature with partial complementarity to the miR172 microRNA, whose precursor we show to be induced upon flowering. These and related findings on SPL genes suggest that microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of flowering.},

	abstract = {Photoperiod is the primary environmental factor affecting flowering time in rapid-cycling accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Winter-annual Arabidopsis, in contrast, have both a photoperiod and a vernalization requirement for rapid flowering. In winter annuals, high levels of the floral inhibitor FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C) suppress flowering prior to vernalization. FLC acts to delay flowering, in part, by suppressing expression of the floral promoter SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1). Vernalization leads to a permanent epigenetic suppression of FLC. To investigate how winter-annual accessions integrate signals from the photoperiod and vernalization pathways, we have examined activation-tagged alleles of FT and the FT homolog, TSF (TWIN SISTER OF FT), in a winter-annual background. Activation of FT or TSF strongly suppresses the FLC-mediated late-flowering phenotype of winter annuals; however, FT and TSF overexpression does not affect FLC mRNA levels. Rather, FT and TSF bypass the block to flowering created by FLC by activating SOC1 expression. We have also found that FLC acts as a dosage-dependent inhibitor of FT expression. Thus, the integration of flowering signals from the photoperiod and vernalization pathways occurs, at least in part, through the regulation of FT, TSF, and SOC1.},

Flowering plants produce floral meristems in response to intrinsic and extrinsic flowering inductive signals. In Arabidopsis, the floral meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) are activated to play a pivotal role in specifying floral meristems during floral transition. We show here that the emerging floral meristems require AP1 to partly specify their floral identities by directly repressing a group of flowering time genes, including SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1 (SOC1). In wild-type plants, these flowering time genes are normally downregulated in emerging floral meristems. In the absence of AP1, these genes are ectopically expressed, transforming floral meristems into shoot meristems. By post-translational activation of an AP1-GR fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we further demonstrate the repression of these flowering time genes by induced AP1 activity and in vivo AP1 binding to the cis-regulatory regions of these genes. These findings indicate that once AP1 is activated during the floral transition, it acts partly as a master repressor in floral meristems by directly suppressing the expression of flowering time genes, thus preventing the continuation of the shoot developmental program.},

Here, we show that SOC1 directly binds to the distal and proximal region of the LFY promoter where critical cis-elements are located. Intragenic suppressor mutant analysis shows that a missense mutation in the MADS box of SOC1 causes loss of binding to the LFY promoter as well as suppression of the flowering promotion function. The full-length SOC1 protein locates in the cytoplasm if expressed alone in protoplast transient expression assay, but relocates to the nucleus if expressed with AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), another flowering pathway integrator and a MADS box protein. The domain analysis shows that co-localization of SOC1 and AGL24 is mediated by the MADS box and the intervening region of SOC1. Finally, we show that LFY is expressed only in those tissues where SOC1 and AGL24 expressions overlap. Thus, we propose that heterodimerization of SOC1 and AGL24 is a key mechanism in activating LFY expression.},

During the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, the shoot meristem of flowering plants acquires the inflorescence identity to generate flowers rather than vegetative tissues. An important regulator that promotes the inflorescence identity in Arabidopsis is AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), a MADS-box transcription factor. Using a functional estradiol-inducible system in combination with microarray analysis, we identified AGL24-induced genes, including SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a floral pathway integrator. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of a functional AGL24-6HA-tagged line revealed in vivo binding of AGL24-6HA to the regulatory region of SOC1. Mutagenesis of the AGL24 binding site in the SOC1 promoter decreased ProSOC1:GUS expression and compromised SOC1 function in promoting flowering. Our results show that SOC1 is one of the direct targets of AGL24, and that SOC1 expression is upregulated by AGL24 at the shoot apex at the floral transitional stage. ChIP assay using a functional SOC1-9myc-tagged line and promoter mutagenesis analysis also revealed in vivo binding of SOC1-9myc to the regulatory regions of AGL24 and upregulation of AGL24 at the shoot apex by SOC1. Furthermore, we found that as in other flowering genetic pathways, the effect of gibberellins on flowering under short-day conditions was mediated by the interaction between AGL24 and SOC1. These observations suggest that during floral transition, a positive-feedback loop conferred by direct transcriptional regulation between AGL24 and SOC1 at the shoot apex integrates flowering signals.},

The Arabidopsis thaliana flowering-time gene SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) encodes a MADS box transcription factor and is one of the key floral activators integrating multiple floral inductive pathways, namely, long-day, vernalization, autonomous, and gibberellin-dependent pathways. To elucidate the downstream targets of SOC1, microarray analyses were performed. The analysis revealed that the soc1-2 knockout mutant has increased, and an SOC1 overexpression line has decreased, expression of cold response genes such as CBFs (for CRT/DRE binding factors) and COR (for cold regulated) genes, suggesting that SOC1 negatively regulates the expression of the cold response genes. By contrast, overexpression of cold-inducible CBFs caused late flowering through increased expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), an upstream negative regulator of SOC1. Our results demonstrate the presence of a feedback loop between cold response and flowering-time regulation; this loop delays flowering through the increase of FLC when a cold spell is transient as in fall or early spring but suppresses the cold response when floral induction occurs through the repression of cold-inducible genes by SOC1.},

The FT gene integrates several external and endogenous cues controlling flowering, including information on day length. A complex of the mobile FT protein and the bZIP transcription factor FD in turn has a central role in activating genes that execute the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. Here we reveal that microRNA156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes not only act downstream of FT/FD, but also define a separate endogenous flowering pathway. High levels of miR156 in young plants prevent precocious flowering. A subsequent day length-independent decline in miR156 abundance provides a permissive environment for flowering and is paralleled by a rise in SPL levels. At the shoot apex, FT/FD and SPLs converge on an overlapping set of targets, with SPLs directly activating flower-promoting MADS box genes, providing a molecular substrate for both the redundant activities and the feed-forward action of the miR156/SPL and FT/FD modules in flowering control.},

	abstract = {The transition from vegetative to reproductive development is one of the most important phase changes in the plant life cycle. This step is controlled by various environmental signals that are integrated at the molecular level by so-called floral integrators. One such floral integrator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is the MADS domain transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1). Despite extensive genetic studies, little is known about the transcriptional control of SOC1, and we are just starting to explore the network of genes under the direct control of SOC1 transcription factor complexes. Here, we show that several MADS domain proteins, including SOC1 heterodimers, are able to bind SOC1 regulatory sequences. Genome-wide target gene analysis by ChIP-seq confirmed the binding of SOC1 to its own locus and shows that it also binds to a plethora of flowering-time regulatory and floral homeotic genes. In turn, the encoded floral homeotic MADS domain proteins appear to bind SOC1 regulatory sequences. Subsequent in planta analyses revealed SOC1 repression by several floral homeotic MADS domain proteins, and we show that, mechanistically, this depends on the presence of the SOC1 protein. Together, our data show that SOC1 constitutes a major hub in the regulatory networks underlying floral timing and flower development and that these networks are composed of many positive and negative autoregulatory and feedback loops. The latter seems to be crucial for the generation of a robust flower-inducing signal, followed shortly after by repression of the SOC1 floral integrator.
Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately degraded during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin a, and PPH expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of PPH, we used a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-regulators of PPH. After dark treatment, leaves of an SOC1 knockdown mutant (soc1-6) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of SOC1-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. SOC1 and PPH expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the PPH promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of SOC1 significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the PPH promoter in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protoplasts. Importantly, soc1-6 pph-1 (a PPH knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of pph-1 during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 inhibits Chl degradation via negatively regulating PPH expression. In addition, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of soc1-6 and SOC1-OE leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively regulates the general senescence process. Seven SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES (SAGs) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and NONYELLOWING1 and SAG113 were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl degradation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.},

We studied the interactions in Arabidopsis between three of these integrators, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), as well as their repression by the MADS box transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). FT is a mobile signal transmitted from the leaf to the meristem to initiate flowering. Using mRNA null alleles, we show that FT and the closely related TSF are not essential for flowering, but that the double mutant is photoperiod-insensitive. Inactivation of both genes also fully suppresses the early-flowering phenotype caused by over-expression of CONSTANS (CO), a transcriptional regulator in the photoperiod pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that TSF and FT have similar biochemical functions by showing that they interact in yeast with the same bZIP transcription factors. Expression of FT or TSF from promoters specific for phloem companion cells drives early flowering of the double mutant, so no expression of either gene is required in the meristem. Furthermore, TSF, like FT, is repressed by SVP, but the triple mutant svp-41 ft-10 tsf-1 expresses SOC1 in the meristem sooner and flowers earlier than ft-10 tsf-1. Thus we distinguish the functions of SVP in repressing FT and TSF in the leaf and SOC1 in the meristem. In addition, a time course of in situ hybridizations suggested that repression of SVP and activation of SOC1 proceed simultaneously in the meristem. These observations clarify the relationships between these early regulators of the floral transition, and further emphasize the relatedness of mechanisms acting in the leaf and meristem to control flowering time.},

We have isolated several new alleles of leafy and constructed a series of double mutants with leafy and other homeotic mutants affecting floral development to determine how these genes interact to specify the developmental fate of lateral meristems. We found that leafy is completely epistatic to pistillata and interacts additively with agamous in early floral whorls, whereas in later whorls leafy is epistatic to agamous. Double mutants with leafy and either apetala1 or apetala2 showed a complete loss of the whorled phyllotaxy, shortened internodes, and suppression of axillary buds typical of flowers. Our results suggest that the products of LEAFY, APETALA1, and APETALA2 together control the differentiation of lateral meristems as flowers rather than as inflorescence branches.},

During the initial vegetative phase, the Arabidopsis shoot meristem produces leaves with associated lateral shoots at its flanks, while the later reproductive phase is characterized by the formation of flowers. The LEAFY gene is an important element of the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase, as LEAFY is both necessary and sufficient for the initiation of individual flowers. We have analyzed in detail the expression of LEAFY during the plant life cycle, and found that LEAFY is extensively expressed during the vegetative phase. In long days, Arabidopsis plants flower soon after germination, and this is paralleled by rapid upregulation of LEAFY. In short days, Arabidopsis plants flower several weeks later than in long days, but LEAFY expression increases gradually before flowering commences. Application of the plant hormone gibberellin, which hastens flowering in short days, enhances the gradual change in LEAFY expression observed in short days. Changes in LEAFY expression before the transition to flowering suggest that the time point of this transition is at least partly controlled by the levels of LEAFY activity that are prevalent at a given time of the life cycle. This assumption is borne out by the finding that increasing the copy number of endogenous LEAFY reduces the number of leaves produced before the first flower is formed. Thus, LEAFY combines properties of flowering-time and flower-meristem-identity genes, indicating that LEAFY is a direct link between the global process of floral induction and the regional events associated with the initiation of individual flowers.},

Genetic and molecular investigations have demonstrated that the plant-specific transcription factor and meristem identity regulator LEAFY (LFY) controls this developmental transition by inducing expression of a second transcription factor, APETALA1, and by regulating the expression of additional, as yet unknown, genes. Here we show that the additional LFY targets include the APETALA1-related factor, CAULI-FLOWER, as well as three transcription factors and two putative signal transduction pathway components. These genes are up-regulated by LFY even when protein synthesis is inhibited and, hence, appear to be direct targets of LFY. Supporting this conclusion, cis-regulatory regions upstream of these genes are bound by LFY in vivo. The newly identified LFY targets likely initiate the transcriptional changes that are required for the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in Arabidopsis.},

This dependency can be explained, at least partly, by GA regulation of the flower meristem identity gene LEAFY (LFY) and the flowering time gene SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1. Although it is well established that GA4 is the active GA in the regulation of Arabidopsis shoot elongation, the identity of the GA responsible for the regulation of Arabidopsis flowering has not been established. Through a combination of GA quantifications and sensitivity assays, we show that GA4 is the active GA in the regulation of LFY transcription and Arabidopsis flowering time under short-day conditions. The levels of GA4 and sucrose increase dramatically in the shoot apex shortly before floral initiation, and the regulation of genes involved in GA metabolism suggests that this increase is possibly due to transport of GAs and sucrose from outside sources to the shoot apex. Our results demonstrate that in the dicot Arabidopsis, in contrast with the monocot Lolium temulentum, GA4 is the active GA in the regulation of both shoot elongation and flower initiation.},

Despite a wealth of genetic data, how LFY functions at the molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we report crystal structures for the DNA‐binding domain of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY bound to two target promoter elements. LFY adopts a novel seven‐helix fold that binds DNA as a cooperative dimer, forming base‐specific contacts in both the major and minor grooves. Cooperativity is mediated by two basic residues and plausibly accounts for LFY's effectiveness in triggering sharp developmental transitions. Our structure reveals an unexpected similarity between LFY and helix‐turn‐helix proteins, including homeodomain proteins known to regulate morphogenesis in higher eukaryotes. The appearance of flowering plants has been linked to the molecular evolution of LFY.

The transition from vegetative growth to flower formation is critical for the survival of flowering plants. The plant-specific transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) has central, evolutionarily conserved roles in this process, both in the formation of the first flower and later in floral patterning. We performed genome-wide binding and expression studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LFY executes these roles. Our study reveals that LFY directs an elaborate regulatory network in control of floral homeotic gene expression. LFY also controls the expression of genes that regulate the response to external stimuli in Arabidopsis. Thus, our findings support a key role for LFY in the coordination of reproductive stage development and disease response programs in plants that may ensure optimal allocation of plant resources for reproductive fitness. Finally, motif analyses reveal a possible mechanism for stage-specific LFY recruitment and suggest a role for LFY in overcoming polycomb repression.},

        abstract = {LEAFY Evolution
It is generally believed that redundancy across gene copies allows for the evolution of novel function in proteins. However, it is less clear how single-copy genes with crucial function may evolve. Sayou et al. (p. 645, published online 16 January; see the Perspective by Kovach and Lamb) examined the evolution of the essential plant transcription factor LEAFY, which is generally found as a single-copy gene. LEAFY homologs in taxa representing the major evolutionary branches of the land plants and algae exhibited three classes of LEAFY binding sites. Structural analysis identified amino acid changes in the proteins, that were responsible for contacts with specific DNA motifs and allowed the likely effects of specific amino acid changes over the evolution of land plants to be resolved.
Transcription factors (TFs) are key players in evolution. Changes affecting their function can yield novel life forms but may also have deleterious effects. Consequently, gene duplication events that release one gene copy from selective pressure are thought to be the common mechanism by which TFs acquire new activities. Here, we show that LEAFY, a major regulator of flower development and cell division in land plants, underwent changes to its DNA binding specificity, even though plant genomes generally contain a single copy of the LEAFY gene. We examined how these changes occurred at the structural level and identify an intermediate LEAFY form in hornworts that appears to adopt all different specificities. This promiscuous intermediate could have smoothed the evolutionary transitions, thereby allowing LEAFY to evolve new binding specificities while remaining a single-copy gene.
Comparative and structural studies reveal how an essential plant transcription factor evolved different specificities. [Also see Perspective by Kovach and Lamb]

The expression of the floral regulators LEAFY, APETALA1 and AGAMOUS-LIKE8 was examined during light treatments that induced flowering in Arabidopsis, and was compared to time points at which floral determination occurred. Extension of an 8-hour day by either continuous red- or far-red-enriched light induced LEAFY and AGAMOUS-LIKE8 expression within 4 hours. The 4 hours of additional light was sufficient for floral determination only in the far-red-enriched conditions, while 12–16 hours of additional light was required for floral determination in the red-enriched conditions. These results indicate that the induction of floral regulatory genes and induction of flower formation can be uncoupled under certain circumstances. Expression of LEAFY and AGAMOUS-LIKE8 in the shoot apex at the time of floral determination is also consistent with genetic data indicating that these genes are involved in the first steps of the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. In contrast to LEAFY and AGAMOUS-LIKE8, APETALA1 expression was first observed 16 hours after the start of photoinduction. Since this time point was always after floral determination, APETALA1 is an indicator of floral determination.},

This 3-kb intron contains binding sites for two direct activators of AG, LEAFY (LFY) and WUSCHEL (WUS), along with other putative regulatory elements. We have used phylogenetic footprinting and the related technique of phylogenetic shadowing to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in this intron. Among 29 Brassicaceae species, several other motifs, but not the LFY and WUS binding sites identified previously, are largely invariant. Using reporter gene analyses, we tested six of these motifs and found that they are all functionally important for the activity of AG regulatory sequences in A. thaliana. Although there is little obvious sequence similarity outside the Brassicaceae, the intron from cucumber AG has at least partial activity in A. thaliana. Our studies underscore the value of the comparative approach as a tool that complements gene-by-gene promoter dissection but also demonstrate that sequence-based studies alone are insufficient for a complete identification of cis-regulatory sites.},

The tfl1-1 mutation causes early flowering and limits the development of the normally indeterminate inflorescence by promoting the formation of a terminal floral meristem. Inflorescence development in mutant plants often terminates with a compound floral structure consisting of the terminal flower and one or two subtending lateral flowers. The distal-most flowers frequently contain chimeric floral organs. Light microscopic examination shows no structural aberrations in the vegetative meristem or in the inflorescence meristem before the formation of floral buttresses. The wild-type appearance of lateral flowers and observations of double mutant combinations of tfl1-1 with the floral morphogenesis mutations apetala 1-1 (ap1-1), ap2-1, and agamous (ag) suggest that the tfl1-1 mutation does not affect normal floral meristems. Secondary flower formation usually associated with the ap1-1 mutation is suppressed in the terminal flower, but not in the lateral flowers, of tfl1-1 ap1-1 double mutants. Our results suggest that tfl1-1 perturbs the establishment and maintenance of the inflorescence meristem. The mutation lies on the top arm of chromosome 5 approximately 2.8 centimorgans from the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker 217.},

	abstract = {Growth of flowering stems in wild-type Arabidopsis is indeterminate. Many flowers arise sequentially on the flanks of apical meristems in a phyllotactic spiral. We have isolated eight recessive mutants of a gene, terminal flower, in which inflorescences become determinate. Flower primordia sooner or later ‘invade’ the meristem summit leading to cessation of its further growth. Primary apical meristems usually terminate with several part-flowers which lack pedicels, and several normal pedicellate flowers may arise first. By contrast apical meristems of secondary branches usually produce only a single pedicellate flower. Plant height is also reduced and more rosette inflorescences develop. These growth patterns occur in six strong mutants raised at 25°C under continuous light. In two weak mutants termination occurs much later with many more flowers arising before eventual termination. Termination is similarly delayed in at least one of the strong mutants grown at lower temperatures. The tfl mutation does not affect the indeterminate growth of flower meristems, at least in-so-far as this occurs in agamous mutants. The tfl locus is at the top of linkage group 5, close to RFLP 447. We propose that the TFL gene product supports the activity of an inhibitor of flower primordium initiation. This inhibitor would normally prevent flowers from arising on the inflorescence apex but in tfl mutants it may readily fall below its threshold of activity. The TFL gene may be one of a class responsible for evolutionary changes between indeterminate and determinate growth.},

Thus, the pathways that regulate inflorescence and floral meristem identity must operate both simultaneously and in close spatial proximity. The TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) gene of Arabidopsis is required for normal inflorescence meristem function, and the LEAFY (LFY), APETALA 1 (AP1), and APETALA 2 (AP2) genes are required for normal floral meristem function. We present evidence that inflorescence meristem identity is promoted by TFL1 and that floral meristem identity is promoted by parallel developmental pathways, one defined by LFY and the other defined by AP1/AP2. Our analysis suggests that the acquisition of meristem identity during inflorescence development is mediated by antagonistic interactions between TFL1 and LFY and between TFL1 and AP1/AP2. Based on this study, we propose a simple model for the genetic regulation of inflorescence development in Arabidopsis. This model is discussed in relation to the proposed interactions between the inflorescence and the floral meristem identity genes and in regard to other genes that are likely to be part of the genetic hierarchy regulating the establishment and maintenance of inflorescence and floral meristems.},

	abstract = {Upon floral induction, the primary shoot meristem of an Arabidopsis plant begins to produce flower meristems rather than leaf primordia on its flanks. Assignment of floral fate to lateral meristems is primarily due to the cooperative activity of the flower meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1), and CAULIFLOWER. We present evidence here that AP1 expression in lateral meristems is activated by at least two independent pathways, one of which is regulated by LFY. In lfy mutants, the onset of AP1 expression is delayed, indicating that LFY is formally a positive regulator of AP1. We have found that AP1, in turn, can positively regulate LFY, because LFY is expressed prematurely in the converted floral meristems of plants constitutively expressing AP1. Shoot meristems maintain an identity distinct from that of flower meristems, in part through the action of genes such as TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1), which bars AP1 and LFY expression from the inflorescence shoot meristem. We show here that this negative regulation can be mutual because TFL1 expression is downregulated in plants constitutively expressing AP1. Therefore, the normally sharp phase transition between the production of leaves with associated shoots and formation of the flowers, which occurs upon floral induction, is promoted by positive feedback interactions between LFY and AP1, together with negative interactions of these two genes with TFL1.},

TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) controls shoot meristem identity throughout the plant life cycle, affecting the number and identity of all above-ground organs generated; tfl1 mutant shoot meristems make fewer leaves, shoots, and flowers and change identity to flowers. We find that TFL1 mRNA is broadly distributed in young axillary shoot meristems but later becomes limited to central regions, yet affects cell fates at a distance. How is this achieved? We reveal that the TFL1 protein is a mobile signal that becomes evenly distributed across the meristem. TFL1 does not enter cells arising from the flanks of the meristem, thus allowing primordia to establish their identity. Surprisingly, TFL1 movement does not appear to occur in mature shoots of leafy (lfy) mutants, which eventually stop proliferating and convert to carpel/floral-like structures. We propose that signals from LFY in floral meristems may feed back to promote TFL1 protein movement in the shoot meristem. This novel feedback signaling mechanism would ensure that shoot meristem identity is maintained and the appropriate inflorescence architecture develops.},

Both encode small, closely related transcription cofactors of ∼175 amino acids. Previous studies identified a potential ligand binding residue as well as a divergent external loop as critical for the differences in activity of FT and TFL1, but the mechanisms for the differential action of FT and TFL1 remain unclear. Here, we took an unbiased approach to probe the importance of residues throughout FT protein, testing the effects of hundreds of mutations in vivo. FT is surprisingly robust to a wide range of mutations, even in highly conserved residues. However, specific mutations in at least four different residues are sufficient to convert FT into a complete TFL1 mimic, even when expressed from TFL1 regulatory sequences. Modeling the effects of these mutations on the surface charge of FT protein suggests that the affected residues regulate the docking of an unknown ligand. These residues do not seem to alter the interaction with FD or 14-3-3 proteins, known FT interactors. Potential candidates for differential mediators of FT and TFL1 activities belong to the TCP (for TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF) family of transcription factors.},

The overall morphology of an Arabidopsis plant depends on the behaviour of its meristems. Meristems derived from the shoot apex can develop into either shoots or flowers. The distinction between these alternative fates requires separation between the function of floral meristem identity genes and the function of an antagonistic group of genes, which includes TERMINAL FLOWER 1. We show that the activities of these genes are restricted to separate domains of the shoot apex by different mechanisms. Meristem identity genes, such as LEAFY, APETALA 1 and CAULIFLOWER, prevent TERMINAL FLOWER 1 transcription in floral meristems on the apex periphery. TERMINAL FLOWER 1, in turn, can inhibit the activity of meristem identity genes at the centre of the shoot apex in two ways; first by delaying their upregulation, and second, by preventing the meristem from responding to LEAFY or APETALA 1. We suggest that the wild-type pattern of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 and floral meristem identity gene expression depends on the relative timing of their upregulation.},

Residues responsible for the opposite activities of FT and TFL1 were mapped by examining plants that overexpress chimeric proteins. A region important in vivo localizes to a 14‐amino‐acid segment that evolves very rapidly in TFL1 orthologs, but is almost invariant in FT orthologs. Crystal structures show that this segment forms an external loop of variable conformation. The only residue unambiguously distinguishing the FT and TFL1 loops makes a hydrogen bond with a residue near the entrance of a potential ligand‐binding pocket in TFL1, but not in FT. This pocket is contacted by a C‐terminal peptide, which also contributes to the opposite FT and TFL1 activities. In combination, these results identify a molecular surface likely to be recognized by FT‐ and/or TFL1‐specific interactors.},

        abstract = {We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein, Id. Id is missing the basic region adjacent to the HLH domain that is essential for specific DNA binding in another HLH protein, MyoD. An in vitro translation product of Id can associate specifically with at least three HLH proteins (MyoD, E12, and E47) and attenuate their ability to bind DNA as homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes. Id is expressed at varying levels in all cell lines tested. In three cell lines that can be induced to undergo terminal differentiation, Id RNA levels decrease upon induction. Transfection experiments indicate that over-expression of Id inhibits the trans-activation of the muscle creatine kinase enhancer by MyoD. Based on these findings, we propose that HLH proteins lacking a basic region may negatively regulate other HLH proteins through the formation of nonfunctional heterodimeric complexes.},

K., Rutkowski, R., and Kim, P. S. (1992) Cell 68, 699-708). Using a similar approach, we show that among these residues two pairs of oppositely charged amino acids account in fact for most of the additional free energy of heterodimerization in this system. These residues are 2 glutamic acid side chains in positions g1 and e2 of the Fos leucine zipper and 2 lysine residues in the equivalent positions of the Jun zipper. These amino acids were placed in the context of a GCN4 leucine zipper using peptide synthesis. These peptides contain unique cysteine residues enabling the formation of covalent dimers. The gain in heterodimer free energy has been determined both by cysteine-linked dimer formation under redox conditions and by thermal melting experiments of covalent dimers using circular dichroism experiments. The two pairs of oppositely charged residues (Glu,Glu and Lys,Lys) in positions g1 and e2 contribute at least -1.9 kcal/mol of additional free energy, accounting for a 50-fold excess of the heterodimer with respect to one of the homodimers. Thermal denaturation studies as a function of pH and ionic strength suggest that electrostatic effects should indeed be a major driving force for heterodimerization. On the contrary, peptides harboring the 12 amino acids from Jun and Fos in the other e and g positions (i.e. in e1, g2, e3, g3, e4, and g4) show only a moderate tendency to form heterodimers.},

Florigen is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem and initiates floral evocation. In shoot apical cells, conserved cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins act as florigen receptors. A hexameric florigen activation complex (FAC) composed of Hd3a, 14-3-3 proteins, and OsFD1, a transcription factor, activates OsMADS15, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis APETALA1, leading to flowering. Because FD is a key component of the FAC, we characterized the FD gene family and their functions. Phylogenetic analysis of FD genes indicated that this family is divided into two groups: (i) canonical FD genes that are conserved among eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots; and (ii) Poaceae-specific FD genes that are organized into three subgroups: Poaceae FD1, FD2 and FD3. The Poaceae FD1 group shares a small sequence motif, T(A/V)LSLNS, with FDs of eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots. Overexpression of OsFD2, a member of the Poaceae FD2 group, produced smaller leaves with shorter plastochrons, suggesting that OsFD2 controls leaf development. In vivo subcellular localization of Hd3a, 14-3-3 and OsFD2 suggested that in contrast to OsFD1, OsFD2 is restricted to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins, and interaction of Hd3a with 14-3-3 facilitates nuclear translocation of the FAC containing OsFD2. These results suggest that FD function has diverged between OsFD1 and OsFD2, but formation of a FAC is essential for their function.},

To elucidate the structural mechanisms of DNA binding and selective dimerization of CREB, we determined to 3.0 Å resolution, the structure of the CREB bZIP (residues 283–341) bound to a 21-base pair deoxynucleotide that encompasses the canonical 8-base pair somatostatin cAMP response element (SSCRE). The CREB dimer is stabilized in part by ionic interactions from Arg314 to Glu319′and Glu328 to Lys333′ as well as a hydrogen bond network that links the carboxamide side chains of Gln322′-Asn321-Asn321′-Gln322. Critical to family selective dimerization are intersubunit hydrogen bonds between basic region residue Tyr307 and leucine zipper residue Glu312, which are conserved in all CREB/CREM/ATF-1 family members. Strikingly, the structure reveals a hexahydrated Mg2+ ion bound in the cavity between the basic region and SSCRE that makes a water-mediated DNA contact. DNA binding studies demonstrate that Mg2+ ions enhance CREB bZIP:SSCRE binding by more than 25-fold and suggest a possible physiological role for this ion in somatostatin cAMP response element and potentially other CRE-mediated gene expression.},

Rational protein design has applications in developing biotherapeutics and in advancing synthetic biology and nanotechnology. Rational protein-interaction design has been approached in many ways over the past decades, but it remains a challenge. Computational methods require models to predict binding and tools for applying predictive models in design. Many such methods are based on modeling and evaluating protein structure using physical or semi-physical energy terms. In this work, we used a different strategy, deriving a binding model that describes the protein-protein interactions of basic-region leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcriptions factors directly from a large body of experimental interaction data. Our model showed much better performance than previously published predictors. We used our model, in conjunction with a protein-design strategy that builds new proteins from modular parts of known proteins, to successfully design novel bZIP-like protein domains. We demonstrated experimentally that the designed proteins bind tightly and specifically to a number of human bZIPs that regulate important processes including stress responses and oncogenesis.},

We report here on the mapping and subsequent analysis of these two loci. FRI was mapped to the top of chromosome 4 between markers w122 and m506, using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Due to lack of segregation in of the late-flowering phenotype under the environmental conditions used, KRY could only be localized, by “subtractive genotyping”, to chromosome 5 or part of chromosome 3. The map position of FRI indicates that it is not allelic to any of the late-flowering loci identified by mutagenesis of the early-flowering ecotype Landsberg erecta. The late-flowering phenotype conferred by the Stockholm allele of FRI is modified (towards earlier flowering) by Landsberg erecta alleles at an unknown number of loci, perhaps accounting for the absence of fri mutations among mutant lines recovered in Landsberg erecta.},

The extreme lateness of dominant FRI alleles depends on dominant alleles at the FLC locus that maps on the top of chromosome 5. FLC alleles with this effect have been found in all ecotypes tested (Col, Ws, S96, Est and Li) except Ler. Most likely the same locus confers lateness to the luminidependens (ld) mutant. Genotypes with a dominant FRI allele and the monogenic recessive ld mutant are only slightly later with recessive Ler alleles at the FLC locus.

Forty-two double mutants involving 10 of these loci were obtained and analyzed for their flowering behavior under long-day conditions, with and without vernalization, and under short-day conditions. The genetic interactions between the various mutants proved to be complex, although a major epistatic group (called group A) could be identified corresponding to the mutants, which are relatively insensitive to vernalization and daylength. In contrast, the genetic behavior of the mutants much more responsive to these environmental factors (group B) is more complex. The vernalization responsiveness of the group B mutants did not compensate for the lateness of the group A mutants. This indicated that these genes do not control vernalization sensitivity as such, but provide a factor that becomes limiting in short days. The classification of these mutants in different physiological groups is discussed in relation to the detected genetic interactions, and based on these interactions a more detailed model of their role in flowering initiation is proposed.},

This vernalization-suppressible, late-flowering phenotype results from the presence of dominant, late-flowering alleles at two loci, FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). In this study, we report that flc null mutations result in early flowering, demonstrating that the role of active FLC alleles is to repress flowering. FLC was isolated by positional cloning and found to encode a novel MADS domain protein. The levels of FLC mRNA are regulated positively by FRI and negatively by LUMINIDEPENDENS. FLC is also negatively regulated by vernalization. Overexpression of FLC from a heterologous promoter is sufficient to delay flowering in the absence of an active FRI allele. We propose that the level of FLC activity acts through a rheostat-like mechanism to control flowering time in Arabidopsis and that modulation of FLC expression is a component of the vernalization response.},

The FLF gene appears to integrate the vernalization-dependent and autonomous flowering pathways because its expression is regulated by genes in both pathways. The level of FLF mRNA is downregulated by vernalization and by a decrease in genomic DNA methylation, which is consistent with our previous suggestion that vernalization acts to induce flowering through changes in gene activity that are mediated through a reduction in DNA methylation. The flf-1 mutant requires a greater than normal amount of an exogenous gibberellin (GA3) to decrease flowering time compared with the wild type or with vernalization-responsive late-flowering mutants, suggesting that the FLF gene product may block the promotion of flowering by GAs. FLF maps to a region on chromosome 5 near the FLOWERING LOCUS C gene, which is a semidominant repressor of flowering in late-flowering ecotypes of Arabidopsis.},

Previous work has shown that the Landsberg erecta allele of FLC, which is not a null allele, is able to partially suppress the late-flowering phenotype of FRIGIDA and mutations in the autonomous pathway. In this study, using a null allele of FLC, we show that the late-flowering phenotype of FRIGIDA and autonomous pathway mutants are eliminated in the absence of FLC activity. In addition, we have found that the downregulation of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 by FRI and autonomous pathway mutants also is mediated by FLC. Complete loss of FLC function, however, does not eliminate the effect of vernalization. Thus, FRI and the autonomous pathway may act solely to regulate FLC expression, whereas vernalization is able to promote flowering via FLC-dependent and FLC-independent mechanisms.},

We show that the two stages of the response of FLC to vernalization, the repression of FLC and the maintenance of the repression during growth at normal temperatures after vernalization, are mediated through different regions of the FLC gene.

	abstract = {Plant species have evolved a wide variety of flowering habits, each adapted to maximize reproductive success in their local environment. Even within a species, accessions from different environments can exhibit markedly different flowering behavior. In Arabidopsis, some accessions are rapid-cycling summer annuals, whereas others accessions are late flowering and vernalization responsive and thus behave as winter annuals. Two genes, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FRIGIDA (FRI), interact synergistically to confer the winter-annual habit. Previous work has shown that many summer-annual accessions contain null mutations in the FRI gene; thus it appears that these summer-annual accessions have arisen from winter-annual ancestors by losing FRI function. In this work we demonstrate that naturally occurring allelic variation in FLC has provided another route to the evolution of summer-annual flowering behavior in Arabidopsis. We have identified two summer-annual accessions, Da (1)-12 and Shakhdara, that contain functional alleles of FRI, but are early flowering because of weak alleles of FLC. We have also determined that the weak allele of FLC found in Landsberg erecta is naturally occurring. Unlike accessions that have arisen because of loss-of-function mutations in FRI, the FLC alleles from Da (1)-12, Shakhdara, and Landsberg erecta are not nulls; however, they exhibit lower steady-state mRNA levels than strong alleles of FLC. Sequence analysis indicates that these weak alleles of FLC have arisen independently at least twice during the course of evolution.},

A mutant in which FLK was inactivated by T-DNA insertion exhibited a severe late flowering phenotype both in long and short days.

The FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcription was greatly upregulated, whereas those of FLOWERING LOCUS T and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 decreased in the mutant.

Here we show that loss-of-function of SET DOMAIN GROUP 8 (SDG 8), which encodes a homologue of the yeast SET2 histone methyltransferase, results in reduced dimethylation of histone H3K36, particularly in chromatin associated with the FLC promoter and the first intron, regions that contain essential cis-elements for transcription. sdg8 mutants display reduced FLC expression and flower early, establishing SDG8-mediated H3K36 methylation as a novel epigenetic memory code required for FLC expression in preventing early flowering.

We previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) with temperature-specific effects on the circadian rhythm of leaf movement, including a QTL linked to the transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We have now analyzed FLC alleles in near-isogenic lines and induced mutants to eliminate other candidate genes. We showed that FLC lengthened the circadian period specifically at 27°C, contributing to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Known upstream regulators of FLC expression in flowering time pathways similarly controlled its circadian effect. We sought to identify downstream targets of FLC regulation in the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock using genome-wide analysis to identify FLC-responsive genes and 3503 transcripts controlled by the circadian clock. A Bayesian clustering method based on Fourier coefficients allowed us to discriminate putative regulatory genes. Among rhythmic FLC-responsive genes, transcripts of the transcription factor LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) correlated in peak abundance with the circadian period in flc mutants. Mathematical modeling indicated that the modest change in peak LUX RNA abundance was sufficient to cause the period change due to FLC, providing a molecular target for the crosstalk between flowering time pathways and circadian regulation.},

	abstract = {Floral development at the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem occurs in response to environmental cues that are perceived in different tissues. Photoperiod is detected in the vascular tissue of the leaf (phloem) and promotes production of a systemic signal that induces flowering at the meristem. Vernalization, the response to winter temperatures, overcomes a block on photoperiodic floral induction. In Arabidopsis, this block is caused by inhibitors of flowering that comprise several related MADS-box transcription factors, the most prominent of which is FLC. We show that FLC delays flowering by repressing production in the leaf of at least two systemic signals, one of which is controlled by the RAF kinase inhibitor-like protein FT. Reducing expression of these signals indirectly represses expression of genes involved in floral induction at the meristem. In addition, FLC expression in the meristem impairs response to the FT signal by directly repressing expression of the SOC1 MADS-box transcription factor and preventing up-regulation of the bZIP transcription factor FD. Repression of genes acting at multiple levels in this hierarchy is required for the extreme delay in flowering caused by FLC. An FLC:HA fusion protein binds directly in vivo to the promoter regions of FD and SOC1 and to the first intron of FT. Thus vernalization relieves transcriptional repression of key regulatory genes in both the leaf and meristem, allowing production of systemic signals in the leaves and conferring competence on the meristem to respond to these signals.},

In yeast and humans, H2A.Z is deposited into chromatin by a conserved protein complex known as SWR1 and SRCAP, respectively. Here, we show that mutations in the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of two components of this complex, ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN6 (ARP6) and PHOTOPERIOD-INDEPENDENT EARLY FLOWERING1 (PIE1), produce similar developmental phenotypes and result in the misregulation of a common set of genes. Using H2A.Z-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that ARP6 and PIE1 are required for the deposition of H2A.Z at multiple loci, including the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) gene, a central repressor of the transition to flowering. Loss of H2A.Z from chromatin in arp6 and pie1 mutants results in reduced FLC expression and premature flowering, indicating that this histone variant is required for high-level expression of FLC. In addition to defining a novel mechanism for the regulation of FLC expression, these results support the existence of a SWR1-like complex in Arabidopsis and show that H2A.Z can potentiate transcriptional activation in plants. The finding that H2A.Z remains associated with chromatin throughout mitosis suggests that it may serve an epigenetic memory function by marking active genes and poising silenced genes for reactivation.},

This process has been shown to require conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) components including the Su(z)12 homologue, VRN2, and two plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins, VRN5 and VIN3. However, the sequence of events leading to FLC repression was unclear. Here we show that, contrary to expectations, VRN2 associates throughout the FLC locus independently of cold. The vernalization-induced silencing is triggered by the cold-dependent association of the PHD finger protein VRN5 to a specific domain in FLC intron 1, and this association is dependent on the cold-induced PHD protein VIN3. In plants returned to warm conditions, VRN5 distribution changes, and it associates more broadly over FLC, coincident with significant increases in H3K27me3. Biochemical purification of a VRN5 complex showed that during prolonged cold a PHD-PRC2 complex forms composed of core PRC2 components (VRN2, SWINGER [an E(Z) HMTase homologue], FIE [an ESC homologue], MSI1 [p55 homologue]), and three related PHD finger proteins, VRN5, VIN3, and VEL1. The PHD-PRC2 activity increases H3K27me3 throughout the locus to levels sufficient for stable silencing. Arabidopsis PHD-PRC2 thus seems to act similarly to Pcl-PRC2 of Drosophila and PHF1-PRC2 of mammals. These data show FLC silencing involves changed composition and dynamic redistribution of Polycomb complexes at different stages of the vernalization process, a mechanism with greater parallels to Polycomb silencing of certain mammalian loci than the classic Drosophila Polycomb targets.},

Downregulation of FLC accelerates the transition from vegetative to reproductive development in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the atx1 mutant, FLC levels are reduced and the FLC chromatin is depleted of trimethylated, but not dimethylated, histone 3 lysine 4, suggesting a specific trimethylation function of ATX1. In addition, we found that ATX1 directly binds the active FLC locus before flowering and that this interaction is released upon the transition to flowering.

We are investigating the link between non-coding RNA and chromatin regulation through analysis of FLC — a regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis and a target of several chromatin pathways. Here we use an unbiased strategy to characterize non-coding transcripts of FLC and show that sense/antisense transcript levels correlate in a range of mutants and treatments, but change independently in cold-treated plants. Prolonged cold epigenetically silences FLC in a Polycomb-mediated process called vernalization. Our data indicate that upregulation of long non-coding antisense transcripts covering the entire FLC locus may be part of the cold-sensing mechanism. Induction of these antisense transcripts occurs earlier than, and is independent of, other vernalization markers and coincides with a reduction in sense transcription. We show that addition of the FLC antisense promoter sequences to a reporter gene is sufficient to confer cold-induced silencing of the reporter. Our data indicate that cold-induced FLC antisense transcripts have an early role in the epigenetic silencing of FLC, acting to silence FLC transcription transiently. Recruitment of the Polycomb machinery then confers the epigenetic memory. Antisense transcription events originating from 3′ ends of genes might be a general mechanism to regulate the corresponding sense transcription in a condition/stage-dependent manner.},

Much is known about PRC2-induced silencing but key questions remain concerning its nucleation and stability. Vernalization, the perception and memory of winter in plants, is a classic epigenetic process that, in Arabidopsis, involves PRC2-based silencing of the floral repressor FLC. The slow dynamics of vernalization, taking place over weeks in the cold, generate a level of stable silencing of FLC in the subsequent warm that depends quantitatively on the length of the prior cold. These features make vernalization an ideal experimental system to investigate both the maintenance of epigenetic states and the switching between them. Here, using mathematical modelling, chromatin immunoprecipitation and an FLC:GUS reporter assay, we show that the quantitative nature of vernalization is generated by H3K27me3-mediated FLC silencing in the warm in a subpopulation of cells whose number depends on the length of the prior cold. During the cold, H3K27me3 levels progressively increase at a tightly localized nucleation region within FLC. At the end of the cold, numerical simulations predict that such a nucleation region is capable of switching the bistable epigenetic state of an individual locus, with the probability of overall FLC coverage by silencing H3K27me3 marks depending on the length of cold exposure. Thus, the model predicts a bistable pattern of FLC gene expression in individual cells, a prediction we verify using the FLC:GUS reporter system. Our proposed switching mechanism, involving the local nucleation of an opposing histone modification, is likely to be widely relevant in epigenetic reprogramming.},

We identified 505 FLC binding sites, mostly located in the promoter regions of genes and containing at least one CArG box, the motif known to be associated with MADS-box proteins such as FLC. We examined 40 of the target genes, and 20 showed increased transcript levels in an flc mutant compared with the wild type. Five genes showed decreased expression in the mutant, indicating that FLC binding can result in either transcriptional repression or activation. The genes we identified as FLC targets are involved in developmental pathways throughout the life history of the plant, many of which are associated with reproductive development. FLC is also involved in vegetative development, as evidenced by its binding to SPL15, delaying the progression from juvenile to adult phase. Some of the FLC target genes are also bound by two other MADS-box proteins, AP1 and SEP3, suggesting that MADS-box genes may operate in a network of control at different stages of the life cycle, many ultimately contributing to the development of the reproductive phase of the plant.},

Some plants are adapted to wait through the winter before their genetic programs for flowering are initiated. But the duration of winter varies with location, and thus, to avoid flowering too late into the summer or exposing blossoms to frost, the adaptation needs to hold the flowers off for just the right amount of time. Working with Arabidopsis thaliana, Coustham et al. (p. 584, published online 12 July) identified a quantitative mechanism that “counts” off the duration of winter. FLC, a repressor of flowering, carries sequence polymorphisms that direct epigenetic events. Plants with fewer of these polymorphisms are adapted to short winters, and plants with all four polymorphisms are adapted to long winters.
Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have adapted to growth in a wide range of climates. Variation in flowering and alignment of vernalization response with winter length are central to this adaptation. Vernalization involves the epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor FLC via a conserved Polycomb (PRC2) mechanism involving trimethylation of Lys27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). We found that variation for response to winter length maps to cis polymorphism within FLC. A rare combination of four polymorphisms localized around the nucleation region of a PHD-Polycomb complex determines a need for longer cold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that these polymorphisms influence the accumulation of H3K27me3 in Arabidopsis accession Lov-1, both at the nucleation site and over the gene body. Quantitative modulation of chromatin silencing through cis variation may be a general mechanism contributing to evolutionary change.

The recent discovery of biological roles for long noncoding RNAs raises important questions as to how they are themselves regulated. Sun et al. (p. 619) adopted a genetic approach to identify regulators of COOLAIR—a set of antisense transcripts from the locus encoding the major Arabidopsis floral repressor, FLC. Analysis of a mutant misregulating COOLAIR revealed a homeodomain protein that repressed COOLAIR expression via an R-loop covering the COOLAIR promoter. Thus, R-loop stabilization is an integral part of COOLAIR regulation, FLC expression, and flowering time.
Roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in gene expression are emerging, but regulation of the lncRNA itself is poorly understood. We have identified a homeodomain protein, AtNDX, that regulates COOLAIR, a set of antisense transcripts originating from the 3′ end of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). AtNDX associates with single-stranded DNA rather than double-stranded DNA non–sequence-specifically in vitro, and localizes to a heterochromatic region in the COOLAIR promoter in vivo. Single-stranded DNA was detected in vivo as part of an RNA-DNA hybrid, or R-loop, that covers the COOLAIR promoter. R-loop stabilization mediated by AtNDX inhibits COOLAIR transcription, which in turn modifies FLC expression. Differential stabilization of R-loops could be a general mechanism influencing gene expression in many organisms.

The stability of the vernalized state varies among plant species and depends on the duration of cold exposure. In Arabidopsis thaliana, winter leads to epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and the duration of cold is measured through the dynamics of chromatin modifications during and after cold. The growing conditions encountered post-vernalization are thus critical for the maintenance of the vernalized state. We reported that high temperature leads to devernalization and, consistently, to FLC reactivation in Arabidopsis seedlings. Here we show that the repressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3 decreases at the FLC locus when vernalized seedlings are grown at 30°C, unless they were first exposed to a stabilizing period at 20°C. Ambient temperature thus controls the epigenetic memory of winter.},

A major variable was the degree to which different periods of cold caused stable FLC silencing. In accessions requiring long vernalization, FLC expression was reactivated following nonsaturating vernalization, but this reactivation was progressively attenuated with increasing cold exposure. This response was correlated with the rate of accumulation of FLC histone H3 Lys 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).

        abstract = {The winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana requires a prolonged period of cold in order to establish competency to flower, in a process known as vernalisation. Accessions of Arabidopsis worldwide show distinct and highly variable vernalisation responses and a significant amount of this variation has been mapped to a single locus- FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Whilst the source of the variation is known, the particular polymorphisms, and the exact nature by which they influence different aspects of the vernalisation process remains comparatively unexplored.
This thesis addresses two questions: firstly, what genetic features of FLC across different accessions contribute to their distinct vernalisation responses? And secondly, how does the process of vernalisation in different accessions differ to produce these distinct vernalisation requirements? The work presented here addresses these questions from a number of different perspectives.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments point to the role of altered chromatin dynamics as the driver of different vernalisation requirements in two different Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Expression analysis of transgenic chimeric FLC loci containing domains from both rapidly and slowly vernalising accessions highlights the importance of particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in affecting FLC’s propensity to reactivate upon return to warmth after a short period of cold. Finally, analysis of FLC suppression dynamics during cold exposure across a range of accessions illustrates mechanistic differences in vernalisation as the driver of distinct vernalisation requirements.
The work presented in this thesis examines the natural diversity in vernalisation requirements across Arabidopsis thaliana accessions in order to better resolve the nature of such variation, both in terms of its causative features as well as the underpinning mechanism. In doing so, it highlights that a small number of polymorphisms are able to alter the process of vernalisation in significant ways, and that, additionally, the way in which the vernalisation mechanism has been altered varies across accessions.},

Dominant alleles of FRI confer a vernalization requirement causing plants to overwinter vegetatively. Many early flowering accessions carry loss-of-function fri alleles containing one of two deletions. However, some accessions categorized as early flowering types do not carry these deletion alleles. We have analyzed the molecular basis of earliness in five of these accessions: Cvi, Shakhdara, Wil-2, Kondara, and Kz-9. The Cvi FRI allele carries a number of nucleotide differences, one of which causes an in-frame stop codon in the first exon. The other four accessions contain nucleotide differences that only result in amino acid substitutions. Preliminary genetic analysis was consistent with Cvi carrying a nonfunctional FRI allele; Wil-2 carrying either a defective FRI or a dominant suppressor of FRI function; and Shakhdara, Kondara, and Kz-9 carrying a functional FRI allele with earliness being caused by allelic variation at other loci including FLC. Allelic variation at FLC was also investigated in a range of accessions. A novel nonautonomous Mutator-like transposon was found in the weak FLC allele in Landsberg erecta, positioned in the first intron, a region required for normal FLC regulation. This transposon was not present in FLC alleles of most other accessions including Shakhdara, Kondara, or Kz-9. Thus, variation in Arabidopsis flowering time has arisen through the generation of nonfunctional or weak FRI and FLC alleles.},

Much of the difference in vernalization response is apparently due to variation at two epistatically acting loci, FRI and FLC. We present the response of over 150 wild accessions to three different environmental variables. In long days, FLC is among those genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. In short days, FRI and FLC are less important, although their contribution is still significant. In addition, there is considerable variation not only in vernalization response, but also in the response to differences in day length or ambient growth temperature. The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to day length, contribute to flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to differences in vernalization requirement, which are mainly mediated by FRI and FLC, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci.},

Despite recent advances identifying the molecular basis of temperature responses, few studies have incorporated this knowledge into predictive models. Here we develop a method to forecast flowering phenology by modelling regulatory dynamics of key flowering-time genes in perennial life cycles. The model, parameterized by controlled laboratory experiments, accurately reproduces the seasonal changes in gene expression, the corresponding timing of floral initiation and return to vegetative growth after a period of flowering in complex natural environments. A striking scenario forecast by the model under climate warming is that the shift in the return time to vegetative growth is greater than that in floral initiation, which results in a significant reduction of the flowering period. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of gene expression assessment to predict unexplored risks of climate change.},

In winter-annual types of Arabidopsis thaliana, a flowering repressor, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), is expressed at levels that inhibit flowering in the first growing season. Vernalization promotes flowering by causing a repression of FLC that is mitotically stable after return to warm growing conditions. Here we identify a gene with a function in the measurement of the duration of cold exposure and in the establishment of the vernalized state.

We demonstrate that the repression of FLC by vernalization requires homologues of other Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 proteins and VRN2. We show in planta that VRN2 and VIN3 are part of a large protein complex that can include the PcG proteins FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM, CURLY LEAF, and SWINGER. These findings suggest a single protein complex is responsible for histone deacetylation at FLC and histone methylation at FLC in vernalized plants. The abundance of the complex increases during vernalization and declines after plants are returned to higher temperatures, consistent with the complex having a role in establishing FLC repression.},

The promotion of flowering is proportional to the duration of the cold period, but the mechanism by which plants measure time at low temperatures has been a long-standing mystery. We show that the quantitative induction of the first gene in the Arabidopsis vernalization pathway, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), is regulated by the components of Polycomb Response Complex 2, which trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). In differentiated animal cells, H3K27me3 is mostly associated with long-term gene repression, whereas, in pluripotent embyonic stem cells, many cell lineage-specific genes are inactive but exist in bivalent chromatin that carries both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks on the same molecule. During differentiation, bivalent domains are generally resolved to an active or silent state. We found that H3K27me3 maintains VIN3 in a repressed state prior to cold exposure; this mark is not removed during VIN3 induction. Instead, active VIN3 is associated with bivalently marked chromatin. The continued presence of H3K27me3 ensures that induction of VIN3 is proportional to the duration of the cold, and that plants require prolonged cold to promote the transition to flowering. The observation that Polycomb proteins control VIN3 activity defines a new role for Polycomb proteins in regulating the rate of gene induction.},

Here, we show that VIN3 family of proteins nonredundantly functions to repress different subsets of the FLC gene family during the course of vernalization. Each VIN3 family protein binds to modified histone peptides in vitro and directly associates with specific sets of FLC gene family chromatins in vivo to mediate epigenetic silencing. In addition, members of the FLC gene family are also differentially regulated during the course of vernalization to mediate proper vernalization response. Our results show that these two gene families cooperated during the course of evolution to ensure proper vernalization response through epigenetic changes.},
