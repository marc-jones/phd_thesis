![**Quality assurance plots from the RNA samples submitted for sequencing.** These plots are generated by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) to assess the quality of RNA prior to sequencing. The peaks of fluorescence correspond to particular sizes of RNA molecule being present in the sample. The 5S, 18S, and 28S are peaks due to ribosomal RNA. These plots show that in the leaf (**a**) additional peaks are observed in the range 900\ -\ 1600\ nucleotides compared to the apex (**b**). These peaks are likely due to chloroplast RNA. That they are absent in the apex sample suggests the dissection protocol was able to adequately remove the surrounding leaf tissue from the apex.](figuredirectory/qa_plots.pdf){#appendixa:qaplots}


![**Expression differences between A and C genomes are consistent across different tissues and time points.** Density plots of transformed expression levels (log~10~(FPKM)) calculated using different subsets of genes. The data used to generate the density plots consisted of expression data from: **a** all annotated *B. napus* genes, **b** *B. napus* genes that show sequence conservation to an annotated Arabidopsis thaliana gene, and **c** *B. napus* genes that show sequence conservation to an annotated Arabidopsis gene that is present in the FLOR-ID database[TODO].](figuredirectory/plots_supp_fig.pdf){#appendixa:sampledensity}


![**Genes for which homoeologue information is available have fewer genes within the very low region of expression.** Density plots of transformed expression levels (log~10~(FPKM)) calculated using different subsets of genes. The data used to generate the density plots consisted of expression data from: **a** all annotated *B. napus* genes, **b** *B. napus* genes that show sequence conservation to an annotated Arabidopsis gene, **c** *B. napus* genes that show sequence conservation to an annotated Arabidopsis gene that is present in the FLOR-ID database[TODO], and **d** *B. napus* genes for which homoeologue information is available. These plots are generated using apex expression data from the time point taken at day 22.](figuredirectory/homoeologue_supp_fig.pdf){#appendixa:homoeologuedensity}
