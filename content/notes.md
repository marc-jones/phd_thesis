### AP1

Early acting genes that determine the identity of the floral meristem and late acting genes that determine floral organ identity. AP1 required for the tranition of an infloresence meristem into a floral meristem.
Cloned the genes and showed that it encodes a MADS-box containing protein. Uniformly expressed in yound flower primordia and later becomes localised to sepals and petals. The development of secondary flowers can be interpreted as a partial conversaion of a floral meristem into an inflorescence meristem. No hybridizing RNA was detected in roots, stems, or leaves. Earliest expression of AP1 is in young flower primordia and increases as the flower primordia increase in size. AP1 uniformly expressed throughout the floral meristem but not in the infloresencece meristem. At later stages of development AP1 is confined to sepals and petals. From mutant studies, AG is a negative regulator and AP2 is a positive regulator. In lfy mutant there is a partial transformation of late arising flowers into inflorescence meristems, which is enhanced in a lfy ap1 double mutant. AP1 is an A class gene. [@alejandra_mandel_molecular_1992]

TFL1 represses AP1 in the inflorescence meristem. AG represses AP1 in the two inner whorls of WT flowers. AP1 RNA accumulation in the inner two whorls of WT flowers is negatively regulated by AG. TFL1, a gene involved in the maintenance of inflorescence meristem identity, negatively regulates AP1 RNA accumulation in the inflorescence meristem. AG negatively regulates AP1, preventing its expression in the inner two whorls. Found that AP2 is not a regulator, and that the loss of AP1 expression in the ap2 mutant is due to the ectopic expression of AG. AP1 is not necessary for the regulation of AG. Ectopic expression of AP1 and LFY are in part responsible for the conversion of inflorescence meristems into floral meristems. [@gustafson_brown_regulation_1994].

AP1 seems to repress FUL - likely not directly. FUL expressed in infloresence apical meristem and not expressed in flower primordia. FUL is expressed in carpels. [@mandel_arabidopsis_1995]

AP1 overexpression causes a transformation of apical and lateral shoots into flowers, with the plants flowering much earlier. AP1 overexpressed in lfy mutant also shows this conversion, although the flowers produced have the lfy mutant phenotype of sepaloid and carpelloid structures. AP1 is downstream of LFY [@mandel_gene_1995]

CO can act to promote flowering at any stage in plant development. Expression of CO from a constitutive promoter was sufficient to overcome the delay in flowering caused by short days. Active CO frequently terminated shoot development prematurely. AP1 was expressed more slowly in response to CO activation than in response to long days. LFY on the other hand responds at the same rate to CO or to exposure to long days. [@simon_activation_1996]

C-terminal domain of AP1 acts as a transcriptional activator. [@cho_analysis_1999].

LFY and AP1 consitutive promoters cause a reduction in the jeuvenile phase of citrus trees [@pena_constitutive_2001].

AGL24 and SVP only present during early flower development (stages 1 and 2). AP1 directly binds to B, C, and E MADS box floral organ identity genes. AP1-SVP AP1-AGL24 dimers Chip [@gregis_arabidopsis_2009].

AP1 acts upstream of the cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation pathways to suppress meristem activity in the sepal axils. [@han_cytokinin_2014]

Activated AP1 protein and looked at differential expression, and also performed AP1 Chip-Seq. 25% of AP1 targets are TFs. AP1 represses TFL1 and binds to at least two sites in the 3' region. More than 80% of AP1 targets were down-regulated. AP1 appears to establish floral meristem identity by repressing genes that are part of the shoot developmental program. [@kaufmann_orchestration_2010].

### FT

Graft experiments suggested the presence of a florigen, a flower inducing hormone that promotes flowering under inductive photoperiods [@lang_promotion_1977]

FT mutant shows delayed flowering in long days and moderatly delayed flowering in short days [@koornneef_genetic_1991].

Used activation tagging; T-DNA insertion of a viral promoter randomly in the genome. Found a mutant that flowered early regardless of day length and had terminal flowers. FT overexpresser causes AP1 expression in flower primordia. Also accelerates flowering regardless of day length and the status (over or underexpressed) TFL1. Long days in Col, FT expression in cotyledons, apex, hypocotyl but nothing in root. In both long and short days, FT levels in WT increased from young seedlings to older plants, with higher overall levels in long days. Changing CO activity has no effect in a FT overexpression background. FT overexpression caused induction of LFY.  [@kardailsky_activation_1999]

FT gradually increased in with time under both LD and SD photoperiods, although upregulation was delayed and reduced under SD conditions. In the CO mutant, upregulation of FT expression was delayed. Activation of inducible CO causes upregulation of FT, indicating regulation. As upregulation of FT occurs eventually in co mutants and in SD photoperiods there is likely a photoperiod independent pathway. Early flowering of FT overexpressers was correlated with FT mRNA levels. LFY and FT overexpressers produced a terminal flower as soon as the plant germinated. [@kobayashi_pair_1999]

Found a single amino acid residue change conferred TFL1 activity to FT and vica versa. [@hanzawa_single_2005]

FT-dependent accumulation of FUL and SEP3. Full FT action in the leaf is dependent on FD. FT overexpressor flower early. Found a response to ambient temperature changes with the FT overexpresser line. Temperature affected the ability of FT to affect the expression of SEP3. SEP3 necessary for the leaf curling phenotype observed. [@teper_bamnolker_flowering_2005]

FT is the major output of CO activity, and FT acts upstream of SOC1[@yoo_constans_2005]

FLC binds to the SOC1 promoter and to the first intron of FT, consistent with FLC based repression of these genes. FLC proteins are able to form homodimers. [@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006]

In SD grown plants, FT mRNA is low, whereas FT expression was increased in each long day. The expression of FT returned to low levels after return to short days. Inducible CO protein; induction lead to FT increase, with the increase not being seen in untreated leaves. In situ hybridisation experiments and GFP fusions suggested that the FT protein moves from the phloem companion cells to the meristem, as no FT mRNA was detected in the apex. Graft experiments also suggest the FT protein moves. FT protein expressed in the minor veins so to keep it in the leaf is not able to accelerate flowering, suggesting that the hypothesis of FT activating a secondary messanger is wrong. [@corbesier_ft_2007]

FT protein is what moves to the apex. FT with a nuclear localization peptide addition was not able to rescue ft mutants when expressed in the vasculature, but was able to rescue the phenotype when expressed in the apex [@jaeger_ft_2007].

Silenced FT just in phloem companion cells and still found the same effect on flowering as if it was silenced all over the plant.[@mathieu_export_2007]

FT protein is transported from donor to apical region of the recipient within a short period of 24-28 hours. [@notaguchi_long_distance_2008]

FT protein expressed in the leaf is transported to the axillary bud and promotes the floral transition of the axillary meristem. BRC1 inhibits this function of FT. [@niwa_branched1_2013]

FT is an early target of CO. ft mutant delayed the early flowering phenotype of a CO overexpressor, but only partially suppressed the phenotype. [@samach_distinct_2000]

### SOC1

Identified as a gene which was differentially expressed after CO protein activation. Overexpression of SOC1 from 35S promoter caused early flowering under both long and short days. SOC1 not detected in shoot apex of SD grown plants, but present in SAM and leaf primordia of plants in continuous light. Expressed in inflorescence meristem but excluded from young floral primordia. Regulated by autonomous pathway. Shown to have an age response in co and fca mutant background. Upregulation in the CO-activation line was while protein translation was inhibited, suggesting CO activates soc1 directly. [@samach_distinct_2000]

SOC1 overexpression suppresses the effects of FRI. Early flowering in a Col-FRI background. SOC1 mutant flowered late in long and short days, but was later in long days, indicating a photoperiod response, SOC1 overexpression line flowered more rapidly under long days than under short days and still responded to vernalization treatment. FRI in Col background delays the transition from juvenile to adult plant, which SOC1 overexpression sped up, but wasn't able to fully revert the phenotype. Dosage effect of the gene. LFY expression repressed by FRI and SOC1 overexpression cannor overcome such repression. LFY overexpression is able to rescue the late flowering phenotype of Col-FRI. LFY overexpression leads to the formation of flowers in the axils of cauline leaves. When SOC1 is overexpressed in a nonfunctional FRI background, there is conversion of secondary shoots to flowers. Strong expression in the SAM and weaker expression in the leaf primordia during vegetative growth. When the SAM produced flower meristems, the expression domain was expanded and SOC1 was also detected in developing leaves. In Col, expression was strongest in leaves but also detected in vegetative apicies, inflorescence, stems and roots. Increase after floral transition. Negatively regulated by FRI and FLC. Plants grown under short days had less SOC1 expression than long day grown plants. [@lee_agamous_like_2000]

CO overexpressor flowered earlier than wild type under both long and short days. All suppressor mutations of the overexpressor were late flowering when not in the overexpressor background. Two of the suppressor mutations are alleles of FT, while one was an allele of FWA. SOC1 mutants delay flowering under both long and short days. SOC1 mutant has the same effect as FT mutants in both WT and CO overexpressor. [@onouchi_mutagenesis_2000]

CO and FLC have antagonistic effects on flowering time and overexpression of CO can largely overcome the delay in flowering caused by overexpression of FLC. SOC1 and FT were more highly expressed in a CO overexpressor than in WT. FLC overexpression in a CO overexpression background caused SOC1 and FT expression to dramatically decrease. SOC1:GUS not identified in inflorescences and flowers. Found CArG box in the SOC1 promoter found to be bound by FLC in vitro and required for repression in vivo. However, deletion of the binding site did not competely abolish repression. [@hepworth_antagonistic_2002]

Late flowering when knocked out in both long and short days. Found the expression of SOC1 to increase during development, and to be regulated by flowering time genes from both the autonomous and photoperiod pathways. Also showed that SOC1 expression was increased when the plants were treated with GA. SOC1 not expressed in the apical meristem of plants still in the vegetative stage. WT plants have higher amounts of AGL20 in leaves under long days. [@borner_mads_2000]

Rescuing a GA biosynthesis mutant with GA treatment causes a concurrent increase in SOC1 expression. Increase not due to FLC or FT expression, as they did not respond to GA treatment. SOC1 mutant is less sensitive to GA treatment. SOC1 and FT increase during cold in a FLC independent manner; experiments carried out in FLC mutant. SOC1 activation during vernalization in short days is dependent on GA. Repression of FLC is not sufficient for SOC1 activation. However, SOC1 is not the only flowering time determinant regulated by GA. Propose that the GA pathway is the only flowering pathway under short days, and that removal of FLC repression is a prerequisite but is not sufficient for flowering. [@moon_soc1_2003]

Microarray analysis of the shift from short to long day growth. Upregulation of SOC1 in long days affected by both ft and co mutants. SOC1 induction was severely affected by FLC activity. Compared to CO and FT, a mutation in LFY has much more subtle effects, indicating that LFY acts further downstream in the floral induction cascade. Found MADS domain proteins and SBP proteins are highly overrepresented among the genes that are induced in response to photoperiod.[@schmid_dissection_2003]

FT and TSF activation tagged lines flowered early. In the TSF activation line, FT is downregulated and visa verca - potential negative feedback between the genes. Overexpression caused earlier flowering in SD than in LD. In a FRI containing background TSF activation completely suppressed the delayed flowering effect of FRI in LD. FT and TSF suppress the late flowering phenotype of FLC overexpression. Therefore they likely act downstream, rather than reducing the expression of FLC. SOC1 expression upregulated in the tagged lines. FLC expression alone is not sufficient to downregulate SOC1. FT expression was slightly higher in a SOC1 overexpressor line, although may be due to different developmental stages of the plants. FT::GUS was reduced in vernalization sensitive lines, and this repression was dosage dependent. FT and TSF act partially redundantly. [@michaels_integration_2005]

Generated double and triple mutants with a soc1 null mutant. SOC1 further delayed the flowering time of the long day pathway mutants. Additive effect suggests SOC1 regulates flowering partially independently of the long day pathway. soc1 null mutation had no effect on some autonomous pathway (fca, ld) or Col-FRI lines. soc1 in a fve line led to a further delay. Up-regulation of SOC1 is required for full promotion of flowering by vernalization, although ft soc1 double mutants still showed a vernalization response. Flowering time still is affected by FLC in ft soc1 double mutants, indicating additional targets of FLC. soc1 delayed flowering but had little effect on the number of coflorescences that produce secondary shoots, while lfy mutant didn't affect flowering time but had an effect on the colorescences. The double showed many more coflorescences indicating that SOC1 has a functional redundancy with LFY in regulating floral initiation. ft soc1 additive flowering time effect. FT, SOC1 and LFY have both overlapping and independent functions on flowering time determination and floral initiation. FT and LFY have the least overlapping fucntion among the three as the double mutant was very different. Double overexpression lines generally showed additive behaviour. FT -> SOC1 -> LFY. In rice SOC1 mutants affect FT expression, indicating that in that species the interactions are different (different ref). The FT, SOC1 and LFY triple mutant still flowered, indicating other integrators.[@moon_analysis_2005]

Null mutants in agl24, svp and soc1 reduced the effects of an ap1 null mutant. Ectopic expression of AGL24 and SOC1 in ap1 mutant. Induced AP1 activity represses the expresion of SVP and SOC1. AP1 found to bind the regulatory sequences of AGL24, SVP and SOC1. [@liu_specification_2007]

Looked for suppressor of SOC1 overexpression. Found mutations disrupting the SOC1 protein. SOC1 binds LFY promoter. SOC1 is cytosolic, expression with AGL24 allows it to enter the nucleus. The MADS and I domain were found to be important for AGL24 dimerization. AGL24 binds with SOC1 at the LFY promoter. AGL24 is expressed in shoots, stems and inflorescence, but not expressed in roots and young leaves. LFY is only expressed where AGL24 and SOC1 are coexpressed. [@lee_soc1_2008]

AGL24 is a direct regulator of SOC1. SOC1 is upregulated by AGL24 at the shoot apex. SOC1 also found to upregulate AGL24. Created an inducible AGL24 line. The later the AGL24 is induced, the less effect is seen on flowering time. SOC1 activated by AGL24. Found a AGL24 binding site in the promoter of SOC1. SOC1 was found to bind the AGL24 promoter. SOC1 found to bind AP1. AGL24 and SOC1 upregulate each other in response to GA [@liu_direct_2008]

Floral activator SOC1 acts as a negative regulator of the cold response pathway through the direct repression of CBFs. Upregulation of cold-inducible genes in a soc1 null and decreased expression in a SOC1 overexpression under LD and 22oC. Same was true for CBF genes. Cold responsive genes are also cirdacian controlled, but their circadean control was independent of SOC1. ICE1 and HOS1 were not affected by SOC1 changes. Therefore, SOC1 suppresses the cold response pathway through the repression of CBF genes, and it was found there are SOC1 binding sites at the CBF genes. FLC expression increased by CBF overexpression. SOC1 has an effect on freezing tolerance. SOC1 proposed as part of the intermittent cold-sensing pathway for flowering. Vernalization causes a strong induction of CBF genes. [@seo_crosstalk_2009]

mir156 expressed from phloem or apex specific promoters delayed flowering. FUL, SOC1 and AGL42 levels were increased in plants with increased SPL levels. SOC1 and FUL are expressed before AP1 SOC1 and AGL42 are direct SPL8 targets determined with Chip. FUL and SOC1 induction was delayed in fd mutants. FD and SPLs act in parallel. mir156 / SPL pathway is independent of FT/FD. [@wang_mir156_2009]

Review of SOC1 function. [@lee_regulation_2010]

Used ChiP-seq and yeast one hybrid to look at the up and downstream regulators of SOC1. CHIP-Seq peaks found at the SOC1 promoter, suggesting self-regulation. SVP, CBF, SEP3, AP3, PI, SHP2 are all bound by SOC1. SOC1 expression is reduced in inducible AP1, SEP3 and AG lines. AP1 and AG were only able to down regulate SOC1 when WT SOC1 is present, whereas SEP3 can act on the SEP3 promoter independently of SOC1. Proposed that SOC1 directly represses the B-class genes AP3 and PI. SOC1, SVP and AGL24 jointly provide the floral meristem a short lag time in which differentiation is suppressed allowing the establishment of sufficient cells for the inner floral whorls. AP1, SEP3 and AG repress SOC1. [@immink_characterization_2012]

FLC binds to the SOC1 promoter and to the first intron of FT, consistent with FLC based repression of these genes. FLC proteins are able to form homodimers. [@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006]

### CO

CO::GUS expression detected in the vascular tissue of the hypocotyl, the cotyledons and the leaves. Expression also detected at the apex and in the cells of young leaves, restricted to vascular tissue in older leaves. CO expression in the phloem is sufficient to trigger flowering and that expression in the leaf and meristem was not required. ft mutation delayed flowering of phloem expressed CO, but was not as delayed as a ft mutation. CO is vasculature expressed; doesn't move to leaf or meristem. [@an_constans_2004]

Response of FUL, SOC1, SPL3-5 and LFY were only attenuated by co and ft knockouts in a short-long day shift experiment, indicating a CO-independent photoperiod response of these genes [@schmid_dissection_2003]


### FD

late flowering mutation @koornneef_genetic_1991

Screened for suppressors of FT overexpression, a line that causes precocious-flowering. screened late-flowering mutants for their effect on the FT overexpression phenotype. fd mutant only had a weak effect on the precocious flowering phenotype of soc1 activation tagged line or LFY overexpression. FD expression mainly in the shoot apex, did not show circadian oscillation and was not affected by photoperiods. under both long and short days FD mRNA increased with time after germination. localized in nucleus. FT interacts with FD in yeast cells and in vitro. FD showed weak interaction with TFL1 in yeast. Ectopic expression of AP1 was observed in 35S::FD seedlings, with AP1 activation requiring the function of FT. phosphorylation site important for interaction with FT. [@abe_fd_2005]

found FD in an interaction screen with FT. FD is highly expressed at the shoot apex. levels of FD decrease soon after floral primordia start to express AP1. proposed that FD effectively provides spatial specificity for FT action. AP1 and FUL are ectopically activated in leaves in 35S:FD plants, but only during long days. ChIP analysis in a 35S:FD line with FT antibodies pulls out AP1 promoter. [@wigge_integration_2005]

FT and TSF are partially redundant. TSF and FD interact found using Y2H. Didn't find TFL1 interacted with FD. Increase of SOC1 mRNA in the SAM of svp mutants occurs idependently of FT and TSF. SVP binds directly to FT and SOC1. Time course shows that SOC1 expression rises before SVP mRNA has disappeared form the meristem. jang_genetic_2009

phenotype of tfl1 mutant and 35S:TFL1 line is suppressed in the fd mutant background. Upregulation of FD during floral transition in the SAM. Two LFY binding sites are essential for FD upregulation, with LFY found to bind the FD promoter. oscillations in FT are buffered at the AP1 level. Model predicts that TFL1 overexpression lines would suppress flowering. TFL1 is not expressed in the shoot apex under noninductive conditions in WT, and is strongly upregulated upon floral induction. TFL1 is highly expressed in the vasculature in pny pnf, a double mutant that never completes the floral transition. suggests PNY and PNF restrict TFL1 expression to the apex. jaeger_interlocking_2013

### LFY

schultz_leafy_1991
EMS mutant screen identified plants that produced leafy shoots in the place of flowers. Normal flowers are never produced. In place of flowers, coflorescence type structures are produced, although they do not produce flowers. petals and stamens are never produced even in the most flowerlike shoots. Bract formation was also affected by LFY. LFY mutation is epistatic to AP2. LFY is required for lateral shoots to develop as flowers.

weigel_leafy_1992
transformation of flowers into inflorescence shoots is more complete when lfy mutatiuons are combined with ap1 mutations. LFY RNA is expressed strongly in young flower primordia, but not in inflorescence meristems. Number of inflorescence shoots subtended by cauline leaves is increased. In strong lfy mutants, secondary flowers arise from the axils of outer floral organs. LFY expression appears in the floral primordia and increases during flower development. Shortly after the sepals have started to arise, LFY expression abates in the center of the flower. LFY is expressed normally in the apex of ap1 mutant inflorescences. LFY and AP1 act synergistically to promote floral over inflorescence development. LFY is inportant in the conversion of inflorescence meristems to floral meristems. Conversion of flowers into inflorescence shoots is more complete in ap1; lfy double mutants. LFY expression is detected much earlier than AG and AP3. LFY becomes ectopically expressed in tfl shoot meristems.

huala_leafy_1992
LFY mutation causes cauline leaves with axillary buds to develop in many of the positins that would be occupied by flowers in WT. LFY mutation is proposed to block the transition from early inflorescence state, which initiates cauline leaves, to the late inflorescence state, which initiates flowers. Looked at interactions of LFY with other genes that participate in the differentiation of primordia. short days exaggerate the phenotype of lfy mutants. The most flowerlike structures produced in the lfy mutant show a conversion of petals into sepals and stamens to carpels. The similarity to PI and AP3 mutants suggests a similar role for LFY. The sharp boundary between the second and third whorls is maintained through negative regulation of AG expression by AP2 and vice versa. As this sharp boundary is not apparent in a lfy mutant, LFY must play a role in establishing the boundary. LFY plays an important role in determining the developmental fate of a floral meristem. In addition, LFY may also play a tole in maintenance of inflorescence meristems. Apparently contradictory role, in that floral meristems are converted to inflorescence meristems in early plants but inflorescence meristems are converted to floral meristems in older lfy plants, as meristems that are usually indeterminate develop a terminal carpel like structure.

weigel_activation_1993
AP3 and PI not detected at all in ap1; lfy double mutants. Onset of AG expression is delayed in lfy mutant. AG also becomes ectopically expressed in the stem of lfy mutants, as well as in some of the bracts that subtend lfy flowers. In a ap1; lfy mutant, the ag null mutation has no effect.

weigel_developmental_1995
Analysed LFY overexpressor lines. Secondary shoots that arise in lateral positions are consistently replaced by solitary flowers and higher order shoots are absent. In addition the primary shoot terminates in a flower, consistent with LFY repressing TFL1. Secondary meristems immediately get converted to flowers while the primary meristem still develops some leaves, which the authors take as evidence that meristems have to be receptive to LFY activity. The effects of constitutive LFY activity are attenuated in short days. ap2 and ufo null mutants cause additive phenotypes. The ap1 null mutant suppresses the LFY overexpression phenotype, although terminal flowers are still produced. LFY can induce AP1.

blazquez_leafy_1997
The increase in LFY expression was slow in short days, and the rate increased when the plants were moved to long, inductive photoperiods. LFY seems to have a dosage effect. Altering copy number of WT LFY changes flowering time.

okamuro_flowers_1996
can induce floral meristem reversion by manipulating photoperiod in the floral homeotic mutant AG and in plants hereozygous for LFY. in lfy null heteozygotes, switching from long to short days causes floral meristem reversion. LFY is important for the maintainance of flower meristem identity. LFY is haplo-insufficient for the maintenance of flower meristem identity under SDs. treatment of GA during the short days prevented floral meristem reversion, indicating that the GA pathway plays a role.

hempel_floral_1997
Only AP1 was a qualitative marker for floral determination, while expression of AGL8 and LFY was detected before floral determination. LFY, AGL8 and AP1 GUS lines. AP1 and AGL are not expressed early in development. LFY is expressed in young apices of vegetative plants. Both LFY and AGL8 activity increases within the first 4 hours of photoinduction. AP1 induced after LFY and AGL8 (FUL) when given inductive photoperiods.

wagner_transcriptional_1999
Inducible LFY. When activated AP1 expression increased, in presense of protein synthesis inhibitor.

william_genomic_2004
AG and AP3 are potentially indirect targets. AP1 is a direct target. CAL seems to be a direct target but not FUL. Used microarray analysis with inducible line to identify likely LFY targets. Performed ChIP to identify which were bound by LFY in their promoter. CAL and four of the five candidates showing greatest expression differences were bound. Main targets, for which ChIP data showed binding were: At5g60630, At5g49770, At5g03790, At3g61250, At1g16070

eriksson_ga4_2006
GA4 induces LFY expression.

hames_structural_2008
Crystal structure of LFY bound to two target promoter elements. LFY binds as a cooperative dimer. Cooperativity potentially aids LFY in mediating sharp developmental transitions.

Looked for suppressor of SOC1 overexpression. Found mutations disrupting the SOC1 protein. SOC1 binds LFY promoter. SOC1 is cytosolic, expression with AGL24 allows it to enter the nucleus. The MADS and I domain were found to be important for AGL24 dimerization. AGL24 binds with SOC1 at the LFY promoter. AGL24 is expressed in shoots, stems and inflorescence, but not expressed in roots and young leaves. LFY is only expressed where AGL24 and SOC1 are coexpressed. [@lee_soc1_2008]

winter_leafy_2011
ChIP-chip with LFY. Selected high-confidence targets as differentially expressed genes in a lfy null mutant. Transcriptional regulators highly enriched in targets. PI, SEP3, EMF1. PI and SEP3 activated by LFY, EMF1 repressed. Also found LFY to modulate stress responses. LFY represses responses to flg22 and pathogen challenge. Reduce resistance to bacterial colonization. SEP3 is a LFY cofactor, which makes sense why LFY would upregulate it.

hong_regulatory_2003
LFY binds the AG promoter

liu_regulation_2009
SOC1, AGL24 and SVP control floral patterning by directly preventing the ectopic expression of SEP3. SEP3 acts with LFY to activate class B and C gene expression. SVP interacts with TFL2 to modulate trimethylation of H3K27me3, while SOC1 and AGL24 interact with a histone deacetylase to modulate H3 acetylation. Ectopic expression of SEP3 in a soc1; agl24; svp triple mutant. In a soc1; agl24; svp; lfy mutant, ectopic expression of class B and C genes was greatly reduced. lfy;sep3 null mutant showed drastic floral defects. A pull down assay also showed their physical interaction in vitro.

sayou_promiscuous_2014
Found LFY homologs in six species of streptophyte green algae. DNA binding domain was conserved. SELEX experiments to analyse DNA binding specificity. Moss LFY binds to a different motif despite possessing the same 15 DNA binding amino acids as AtLFY. Moss LFY makes additional contact with DNA. Found two amino acid changes that mediated the different DNA motif affinities. Propose that LFY evolved new DNA binding modes independently of changes in copy number. Suggest an evolutionary route from one form of LFY to another through a promiscuous intermediate.

irish_flowering_2010

### TFL1

kobayashi_pair_1999
FT gradually increased in with time under both LD and SD photoperiods, although upregulation was delayed and reduced under SD conditions. In the CO mutant, upregulation of FT expression was delayed. Activation of inducible CO causes upregulation of FT, indicating regulation. As upregulation of FT occurs eventually in co mutants and in SD photoperiods there is likely a photoperiod independent pathway. Early flowering of FT overexpressers was correlated with FT mRNA levels. LFY and FT overexpressers produced a terminal flower as soon as the plant germinated.

hanzawa_single_2005
Found a single amino acid residue change conferred TFL1 activity to FT and vica versa.

shannon_mutation_1991
TFL1 mutation causes early flowering and limits the development ofthe normally indeterminate inflorescence by promoting a terminal flower. Screened for early flowering mutants then analysed those mutants for defects in inflorescence development. Only 1-5 flowers, ending in a terminal floral structure that appeared to be the fusion of two or three flowers in the tfl1 mutant. This is compared to 30-40 flowers in the WT. Flowering acceleration in long and short days. heterozygous tfl1 mutant had a flowering time intermediate with WT and homozygous mutant but did not have a terminal flower, suggesting a dosage effect. Placed tfl1 mutant in ap1, ag and ap2 mutant lines. Additive phenotypes, suggesting TFL1 acts independently. However, TFL1 is epistatic to the indeterminate nature of AP1 mutant flowers.

shannon_genetic_1993
inflorescence meristem identity is promoted by TFL1 and that floral meristem identity is promoted by parallel pathways, one defined by LFY, the other by AP1/AP2. TFL1 is responsible for suppressing LFY function in the cells of the inflorescence meristem. TFL1 is required for the indeterminate lateral meristem phenotype of lfy mutant, suggesting that LFY suppresses TFL1 function in floral meristems. Interactions between TFL1 and AP1/AP2 are also detected, with them repressing each other. AP1/AP2 and LFY are proposed to promote floral meristems in separate pathways.

alvarez_terminal_1992
Floral primordia eventually invade the summit of the meristem, leading to termination of its growth. Propose TFL1 to control the level of this inhibitor. Last few flower primordia arise in quick succession and become progressively closer together and more abnormal until all the apex is occupied.

TFL1 represses AP1 in the inflorescence meristem. AG represses AP1 in the two inner whorls of WT flowers. AP1 RNA accumulation in the inner two whorls of WT flowers is negatively regulated by AG. TFL1, a gene involved in the maintenance of inflorescence meristem identity, negatively regulates AP1 RNA accumulation in the inflorescence meristem. AG negatively regulates AP1, preventing its expression in the inner two whorls. Found that AP2 is not a regulator, and that the loss of AP1 expression in the ap2 mutant is due to the ectopic expression of AG. AP1 is not necessary for the regulation of AG. Ectopic expression of AP1 and LFY are in part responsible for the conversion of inflorescence meristems into floral meristems. [@gustafson_brown_regulation_1994].

liljegren_interactions_1999
tlf1 null mutants look a lot like 35S::AP1 plants. TFL1 expression in subapical regions of primary and secondary shoot meristems. Weak expression early in development, but high levels later in development in primary apex and secondary shoot meristems. TFL1 expression reduced in 35S::AP1 lines.

bradley_inflorescence_1997
TFL1 mutant bolts early and the inflorescence meristem eventually takes on a floral meristem character. Young inflorescences of WT Arabidopsis showed strong TFL1 expression in a group of cells lying just below the apical dome of inflorescence. Also observed expression in the stem of the inflorescence. Shifted WT and tfl1 null mutant plants from LD to SD to try and determine if tfl1 null resulted in shorter time to flowering commitment or an acceleration of bolting with the same flowering commitment time as the wild type. They found it was the former possibility. Weak expression until the commitment to flower, and then expression increased. Weak expression during early development delays commitment to flowering (flowering time phenotype of mutant) whereas increased expression of TFL1 at later stages maintains inflorescence meristem identity (terminal flower phenotype).

ratcliffe_separation_1999
LFY, AP1 and CAL prevent TFL1 transcription in floral meristems on the apex periphery, whereas TFL1 inhibits the activity of meristem identity genes at the centre of the shoot apex. Prevents their upregulation and also prevents the meristem from responding to LFY or AP1. TFL1 and AP1/LFY are expressed in different domains. TFL1 expressed in axillary shoot meristems. 35S::LFY repressed TFL1 expression. Constitutive TFL1 could prevent LFY from conferring a floral identity on young meristems. In a lfy null mutant TFL1 was upregulated. TFL1 was not ectopically expressed however. Constitutive TFL1 can overcome consitutive AP1 activity. In the absense of LFY function, constitutive TFL1 could inhibit the expression of AP1. This shows that TFL1 can delay AP1 activation by pathways other than through LFY. Mutual inhibition between TFL1 and LFY or AP1 and CAL. Constitutive expression of TFL1 and floral meristem identity genes demonstrates that TFL1 prevents a response to them.

conti_terminal_2007
Majority of TFL1 not in the nucleus. TFL1 mRNA was very low during the vegetative phase but was strongly upregulated in the shoot meristem when it switched to an inflorescence identity. WT inflorescences had TFL1 protein distributed throughout their entire meristems, unlike its mRNA, which was restricted to the central region. Main shoot only expressed TFL1 strongly when it was in the inflorescence stage, but axillary meristems expressed TFL1 strongly in the vegetative phase. TFL1 mRNA is restricted to the inner cells of the meristem, but TFL1 protein is small and mobile and moves throughout the meristem. Largely cytoplasmic. Potential explanation for TFL1 being highly expressed in axillary meristems during vegetative growth is that they need stronger 'protection' against FT activation. TFL1 restricts AP1 expression to developing floral meristems. TFL1 can't prevent LFY expression in some cells, suggesting that activating factors are expressed in this region. TFL1 protein was limited to central regions in mature lfy mutant shoots. This suggests that movement of TFL1 in the infloresence meristem is regulated by LFY.

ho_structural_2014
Specific mutations in at least four different residues were sufficient to convert FT into a complete TFL1 mimic. Affected residues regulate the docking of an unknown ligand. Do not alter FD or 14-3-3 protein binding sites. Overexpressed mutated FT and looked for impaired function. TFL1 interacts with FD and 14-3-3 proteins. TCP proteins interact with FT but not TFL1

phenotype of tfl1 mutant and 35S:TFL1 line is suppressed in the fd mutant background. Upregulation of FD during floral transition in the SAM. Two LFY binding sites are essential for FD upregulation, with LFY found to bind the FD promoter. oscillations in FT are buffered at the AP1 level. Model predicts that TFL1 overexpression lines would suppress flowering. TFL1 is not expressed in the shoot apex under noninductive conditions in WT, and is strongly upregulated upon floral induction. TFL1 is highly expressed in the vasculature in pny pnf, a double mutant that never completes the floral transition. suggests PNY and PNF restrict TFL1 expression to the apex. jaeger_interlocking_2013

## FLC

Sanda et al 1996
Some late flowering mutants in Ler required an active FLC allele (from Col) to be crossed into the plant in order for the phenotype to be seen, or causing the phenotype to be enhanced. fca, fpa, and fve mutations are synergistic: the late-flowering phenotype is enhanced by FLC-Col. fd, gi, fwa, ft, fe, and fha showed an additive effect on the flowering time when FLC-Col was crossed in. fd and fe were more dominant in the presense of FLC-Col, in that they mediated a delay even when heterozygous

Lee 1994
Additional locus required to confer late flowering to an active FRI containing Ler line. That locus was FLC. In the presence of Ler-FLC (inactive) Sf2-FRI has a greatly reduced influence on flowering time. FLC-Sf2 acts semi-dominantly in Ler to delay flowering. FLC's effect on active FRI and ld mutant plants is dosage dependent.

Lee 1993
Late flowering phenotype of Sf-2 was vernalization responsive. Crossed the line to Col to determine the factor conferring late flowering phenotype. FRI is dominant. Vernalization abolishes the effect of an active FRI allele

Clarke and Dean 1994
Phenotype conferred by active FRI in a Ler background is dependent on the presence of other loci.

Koornneef et al 1994
FLC is required for FRI action.

Michaels and Amasino 1999
flc null mutants result in early flowering, indicating that FLC is a repressor of flowering. LUMINIDEPENDENS negatively regulates the levels of FLC mRNA. FRI increases the levels of FLC. Overexpression of FLC confers a late flowering phenotype in the absence of an active FRI allele. Extreme late flowering of Col-FRI-sf2 is eliminated in the presence of flc null mutants. FLC mRNA not affected by photoperiod or plant age during vegetative development. FLC is expressed most highly in the vegetative apex and in root tissue but is also detectable in leaves and stems. Found FLC to be downregulated in the apex after the transition to flowering. FLC not detected in the inflorescence meristem of FRI containing lines. FLC transcript reduced after vernalization treatment. FLC was first identified as a suppressor of the late-flowering phenotype conferred by FRI and ld mutations. Late flowering, autonomous pathway mutants are likely to affect FLC expression.

Sheldon 1999
FLC integrates the vernalization and autonomous pathway. FLC downregulated with a reduction in DNA methylation. FLC activator tagged line. Expression is lower in reproductive tissues than it is in vegetative tissues. A longer vernalization period was required to accellerate flowering of a FLC activator tagged line. Additional applications of GA were also required to downregulate FLC in the activator line. Activator line shows dosage dependence. Correlation was found between ecotypes with vernalization requirement and expression level of FLC.

Koornneef et al 1998
Double mutants of late flowering mutants to identify epistasis groups. Two groups of late flowering mutants; those that continue to respond to environmental signals (autonomous pathway) and those that don't (photoperiod pathway).

Levy and Dean 1998 - Review
Four pathways regulating flowering, two endogenous (autonomous and repressive) and two that mediate environmental cues (photoperiod and vernalization). Site of vernalization perception is the shoot apex.

Michaels and Amasino 2001
Late flowering of lines containing active FRI is mediates entirely by FLC using a flc null mutant. The null flc mutant (in a Col background with inactive FRI) did not affect flowering in LD but caused earlier flowering in SD. Late flowering of autonomous mutants is also dependent on FLC. The null mutant still flowered, suggesting that there are FLC-independent vernalization pathways. Downregulation of SOC1 in active FRI or autonomous pathway lines is mediated by active FLC. Overexpression of FLC is sufficient to downregulate SOC1.

Sheldon et al 2002
Used a FLC-GUS line to dissect the regulatory regions directing FLC control. FLC repression is mitotically stable but not stable across generations, suggesting epigenetic control. Identified regions in the first intron necessary for vernalization directed repression. Promoter was also required for downregulation during vern. Region in intron I required for stable repression. Promoter region also required for nonvernalized expression of FLC.

Michaels et al 2003
Found that the summer-annual accessions had that phenology as a result of FLC alleles that are more lowly expressed. Da (1)-12 and Shakhdara accessions have a spring-annual habit, that is converted to a winter-annual habit when an active allele of FLC is introduced. Coding sequence was not different between Col and the other accessions within FLC. Insertion within the first intron causes the weak Ler FLC allele. A similar insertion does not result in the weak FLC alleles of Da (1)-12 and Shakhdara

Lim et al 2004
Activator tagging mutagenesis. Identified FLK, a RNA-binding protein. FLC was 10 times more highly expressed in the flk mutant. Althought the 35S promoter was used for the insertion, the flk mutant lacks expression of FLK. flk is responsive to both vernalization and GA treatment, and is therefore part of the autonomous pathway

Zhao et al 2005
H3K36 methylation is an activating epigenetic mark. Identified mutants in methyltransferases. Mutants were early flowering. Vernalization had no effect on the plants. In the methyltransferase mutants FLC expression was reduced. Found increased H3K4 methylation at FLC. Largest changes in the promoter and the first intron of FLC.

Edwards et al 2006
Temperature compensation of the clock. The period of the clock doesn't change when measured over a broad range of constant temperatures. QTL for temperature-dependent circadean period changes. Compared transcription across time in FRI;FLC lines and fri;flc lines to identify FLC-responsive genes. They then looked at the period of oscillation for this subset of genes, and compared it to FLC. In flc mutants, the period of the clock at 27oC is shortened. The gene LUX seems to mediate FLC's effect on the clock.

Increase of antisense RNA in cold treated plants. This was transient, returning to pre-cold levels after the treatment. COOLAIR is induced prior to VIN3. COOLAIR promoter was able to silence a reporter gene in a cold-dependent manner. COOLAIR might act through promoter interferance.

De Lucia 2008
PRC2 complex mediates H3K27me3. VRN2 associates across all of FLC. VRN5 associates in a position in intron 1 during cold. After subsequent growth in the warm, VRN5 association spreads across the locus. VIN3 and VEL1 are part of a vernalization specific PHD-PRC2 complex. After cold, H3K27me3 redistributed across the FLC locus.

Sun et al 2008

Yang et al 2014
H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 show opposing profiles in the FLC nucleation region and gene body and that they rarely coexist on the same histone tail. H3K27me3 correlated with the presence of PHD-PRC2 at the nucleation region and across the gene body. H3K36me3 initially peaks at the nucleation region, but this is gradually suppressed with increasing cold treatment. Pull downs found that the two histone marks could not coexist on the same histone tail.

Mateos et al. 2015
Identified targets of SVP in the presence and absence of its partner FLC, with FLC ChIP-Seq being performed in the svp null mutant. Transcriptome analysis in SDs. Looked at differentially expressed genes in leaves and apicies as a result of mutating svp and flc. Found more DEGs in the leaf rather than the apex. FLC regulated twice as many genes as SVP in leaves, while the relationship was reversed in apicies. FLC and SVP were required for 30 to 40% of the DEGs identified during the transition from SDs to LDs in WT. Signalling allocation analysis was performed, which is a linear model with SVP, FLC, and FLC:SVP as terms. SVP and FLC control different genes in different tissues (leaf and apex) when acting individually. Presence of FLC increases the number of SVP targets. TEM1, COL1, and COL4 were only bound when both proteins were present. SVP genome-wide targets approximately doubled in the presence of FLC. On the other hand, FLC binding sites were greatly altered by the presence of SVP, but in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner, as the total number of targets did not increase. Heterodimer binds to different sequences. Inidividually the genes regulate flower development, whereas as a complex they regulate flowering time. Degeneracy, different members can perform similar functions in one condition but distinct functions in another. Supports robustness within biological processes while also providing flexibility for adaptation and evolution of the system.

Duncan et al. 2015
Average autumn temperature of Lov1 corresponds to the optimum vernalization temperature. This difference is mediated by FLC. Early vernalization allows the plant to vernalize before snowfall, and flower upon snowmelt in the spring.

Bouché et al. 2015
A period of hot temperature (30oC) after vernalization removes the repressive H3K27me3.

Deng et al 2011
Performed ChIP-seq and -chip with FLC. FD promoter is not bound by FLC. Predominantly acts as a repressor, but seemingly also activates the expression of some genes (looked at targets identified from ChIP in the flc mutant). Targets two SPL genes, SPL15 and SPL3. FLC delays progression from juvenile to adult phase. Large number of FLC targets in hormone repsonse pathways.

Coustham et al 2012
Accumulation of the H3K27me3 repressive mark is delayed in Lov one, leading to it requiring a longer period of cold in order to become stably repressed.

Searle et al 2006
Misexpressed flowering genes in specfic tissues to understand the spatial roles of the genes. FLC acts to repress both the expression of systemic flowering signals in the leaf and the response to these signals at the meristem. Expressed FLC in the phloem and meristem. Expression of FLC in the phloem in a flc mutant delayed flowering. FLC expression in the meristem caused a less pronounced difference. Expression from root specific promoter has no effect. Expression in the phloem represses FT and SOC1 in the leaf. FLC expression in the apex had no impact on leaf levels of FT and SOC1. The delayed flowering of phloem expressed FLC was mostly due to FT. SOC1 expression the phloem was able to partially recover a soc1 mutant. SOC1 is one of the earliest indicators of flower initiation. SOC1 mRNA was detected in the meristem by in situ hybridization within 18 h of transfer of 6-wk-old Columbia plants from SDs to LDs (Borner et al. 2000). FLC expression in the phloem delays expression of SOC1 in the meristem. FD expression at the meristem did not increase after floral initiation in SUC2::FLC plants. In ft mutants SOC1 expression in the meristem is delayed. FT is required for early activation of SOC1 in the meristem under LDs and FT function in the phloem increases SOC1 activity in the meristem. FD is also required for SOC1 expression. FLC expression in the meristem delays and reduces the expression of SOC1. FLC in the meristem delays the increase in FD expression. Expression of SOC1 in the phloem causes an early flowering phenotype which is more severe than the expression of SOC1 in the phloem. SOC1 promotes flowering from the phloem and the meristem. SOC1 in the meristem is capable of accelerating flowering independently of CO and FT. Abundance of SOC1 and FT mRNA was reduced in leaves of FRI FLC plants. FLC expression in the shoot meristem is repressed by vernalization. ChIP experiments show FLC binding to FT, SOC1 and FD. FLC prevents FT expression in the leaf and also represses FD in the meristem, the latter being independent of FT. Phloem expressed SOC1 accelerates flowering, but an ft mutation suppresses this. FD is expressed at a low level during development. FLC maintains FD expression at a low level.

## VIN3

sung_vernalization_2004
Mutagenized Col-FRI and screened for mutants insensitive to vernalization. In vin3 mutant the vernalization response was completely blocked. vin3 blocks the effects of an autonomous pathway mutant in a summer-annual background. VIN3 required for FLC independent vernalization. VIN3 is only expressed during the vernalization period; quickly repressed afterwards. Plant homeodomain, often found in proteins in chromatin remodelling complexes. VIN3 is expressed only after a duration of cold exposure that is effective for vernalization. levels of VIN3 expression is negatively correlated with FLC levels. Vernalization mediated decrease in histone acetylation is not seen in vin3 mutant. Increase in H3K9me3 not seen in vin3. Consititutive VIN3 is not sufficient to substitute for cold treatment; thus VIN3 must interface with other cold-induced changes.

wood_arabidopsis_2006
VRN2 is part of a PRC2-like complex in plants and this complex acts to regulate FLC expression in both nonvernalized and vernalized conditions. PHD protein VIN3 can be in the same complex as VRN2. Complex accumulates during cold. VRN2, FIE, CLF, and SWN proteins increase in abundance, but not mRNA. POLYCOMB REPRESSION COMPLEX2 mediates H3K27 methylation.

kim_vernalization_mediated_2010
VIN3 is in a region of heterochromatin due to a transposable element upstream of the gene. Observed a significantly elevated level of VIN3 mRNA expression prior to cold exposute in lhp1 mutants. LHP1 and CLF associate with VIN3 chromatin, but do not dissociate during cold. Do not observe change in H3K27me3 at VIN3. H3K4me3 is highly enriched during VIN3 activation during cold. Bivalent state established. Suggest that the slow response of VIN3 to cold is due to LHP1-mediated repression. Activating complexes are PAF1 and EFS.

jean_finnegan_polycomb_2011
Induction of VIN3 does not require removal of H3K27me3. H3 acetylation, an active mark, increases within 24h of VIN3 induction. H3K4me3, increased around the VIN3 transcription start site within 24 h at low temperatures, and the level of H3K36me3 had increased up to 2.5-fold within the coding region. H3K4me3 returned to basal levels upon move to warmer conditions. H3 acetylation remained at the promoter when moving to warm conditions. Bivalently marked histones. VIN3 activation during cold was more rapid in PRC2 mutants.

kim_coordination_2013
FLC family - FLM and MAF1-5
VIN3 is expressed only during vernilizing cold, VIL1/VRN5 is consititutively expressed. Slight upregulation of VIL2/VEL1 during vernilization. VIL3/VEL2 is increased after cold exposure. FLC, FLM, MAF2, and MAF3 are repressed as a result of vernalization. MAF4 and MAF5 are increased during early periods of cold exposure. maf4 and maf5 mutants have a precocious vernalization response.

Simple models can be limited in their ability to describe genotypic differences, limited in use for process level physiology and limited in ability to respond to a wide range of management practices. Simple models often have parameters that are site specific.

Complex models are better able to model genotype by environment differences, to include intrinsic feedback mechanisms and to handle variable management conditions. Require more input information and parameterization and may be more unstable.

statistical models more useful at broader spatial scales. process based models require extensive input data on cultivar, management and soil conditions that are often unavailable. three main types of statistical model: time series from a single point or area, variations in time and space (panel models), variations in space (cross-section methods). Time series models can capture the behaviour in a particular area, while panel and cross-section methods must assume common parameters values for all locations. This also means that TS models often lack data, whereas the others can combine data from multiple sites. parameter co-linearity between predictor avriables, assumptions of past relationships holding, low signal to noise rations in yield. statistical models can reproduce key aspects of more complex models. time series models seem better at predicting precipitation, whereas panel and crosssection models are better for estimating temperature responses. in general, statistical models become more appropriate as the scale of interest increases.

Two copies of *TFL1* were identified in both *B. rapa* and *B. oleracea*, with three found in *B. napus*(Mimida 1999).
As was found in Arabidopsis, *BnTFL1* was expressed in the flowers.
While very few nonsynonomous mutations were found between the copies within *B. napus*, sequence variation was identified within the first intron of the gene and in the 3' regulatory regions(Mimida 1999).
Mutations in the A10 copy of *BnTFL1* caused a delay in flowering, affected internode elongation, and potentially caused an increase in seed number and weight (guo et al 2014).

## Deleted from intro spring chapter

One consideration for seed development are the environmental conditions during which the seeds develop[@penfield_effects_2017], with light quality and temperature both affecting the germination of Arabidopsis seeds.

In plants grown in natural conditions, having heterogeneous flowering times among a population of plants of the same species likely confers an advantage at the population level.
However, in an agronomic setting having a heterogeneous flowering time makes the maintenance of the crop more difficult.
For example, pollen beetles are simultaneously a pollinator and a pest of *Brassica napus*.
When the flowers are in the bud stage they are susceptible to damage from the beetles, but later in development the beetles act as pollinators to the plant[@williams_feeding_1978].
Application of pesticides to control pollen beetles are therefore complicated if plants are at different stages of the floral transition.
RICHARD'S COMMENT: How can flowering be tightly controlled and yet heterogeneous

Dosage balancing is a result of certain proteins being required in the correct stoichiometry in order to function.
The formation of a protein complex is a good example.
In whole genome multiplication events there will be additional copies of all the genes whose products form the complex.
This will maintain the stoichiometry of the proteins, allowing the protein complex to form.
If failure to form a viable protein complex leads to a deleterious phenotype, the genes will then tend to be retained in the genome in order to maintain the stoichiometry of the complex.
Conversely, small scale multiplication events are likely to only result in additional copies of one of the genes that encode a protein from the complex.
As the stoichiometry of the proteins that form the complex have been altered this can lead to a deleterious phenotype.
In such a situation, selective pressures will lead to the loss of such a multiplied gene.
An expectation of the gene dosage hypothesis is that genes retained in the genome as a result of dosage effects will be similarly regulated.
Studying the expression of genes can therefore suggest what evolutionary forces have driven their retention in the genome.

    #### potentially include this in discussion

    The downside of sampling the shoot apical meristem is the destructive nature of the sampling, in that we could not take samples from the same plant over the course of development.
    This potentially introduces noise into the data if the plants sampled at different time points do not have synchronized development.
    It was felt that the potential insights made possible by having transcriptome data from the apex would offset this downside.
    Additionally, the plants were grown together and there was sufficient replication and sample pooling that factoring in this noise was not an issue.

## Deleted from FLC

### intro
*FLC* is expressed most highly in the vegetative apex but was also detectable in leaves and stems[@michaels_flowering_1999].
However, the activity of the gene in the leaves and apical meristem was found to differ[@searle_transcription_2006].
In elegant experiments expressing *FLC* from tissue specific promoters, Searle et al. showed that *FLC* has a dual role repressing *FT* in leaves and *FD* and *SOC1* in the apex[@searle_transcription_2006].
Repression of both the floral signal (*FT*) and the means by which that signal is integrated by the plant (*FD* and *SOC1*) likely contributes to the repressive effects of the gene.
Finally, in terms of specific target genes, FLC binds the floral integrators *FT*, *SOC1*, and *FD*, suggesting that the repression of flowering by FLC is through direct regulation of these three floral activators[@searle_transcription_2006].
DNA binding studies have identified many targets across the genome for *FLC*.
As MADS box transcription factors dimerize in order to bind to DNA, the binding of FLC protein in the presence and absence of another MADS box containing protein called SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) was investigated[@mateos_combinatorial_2015].
The results found that the targets of the FLC homodimer and the SVP:FLC heterodimer varied, with the heterodimer tending to regulate genes associated with floral induction, while the FLC homodimer was biased towards targets involved with floral development.
FLC protein was also found to bind targets in the hormone response pathways[@deng_flowering_2011], while also influencing the periodicity of the circadean clock[@edwards_flowering_2006].

### discussion
The *BnFLC* genes show a range of different expression patterns, with certain copies varying between the winter and spring variety more than others.
The expression of *FLC* in *A. thaliana* can be thought of a typical response for a vernalization sensitive gene; low expression in spring varieties and high initial expression in winter, vernalization-requiring varieties that decreases upon cold treatment.
The *Brassica napus* copies that exhibit this typical response are the A2, A3b, C2, C3c, and A10 copies, in both the leaf and the apex.
*BnFLC.C3a* also exhibits this response in the leaf, but the expression of the gene is only just over the expression threshold used in this study, calling into question whether the gene has a role in the vernalization response in *B. napus*.
Of the six copies exhibiting the typical vernalization response in both tissues, the C2, A3b, C3c copies in the apex and all six copies in the leaf undergo some level of expression reactivation after the vernalization period.
Based on this, the A2 and A10 copies are left as the most plausible *BnFLC* copies mediating the vernalization response in Tapidor, due to both having a typical vernalization expression profile and stable repression in the apex.
Of the genes in which reactivation occurs, however, only *BnFLC.C2* in Tapidor apex fully reactivates to pre-cold levels.
Therefore the potential effect on the vernalization requirement of Tapidor by copies showing partial reactivation should not be discounted.

Although there are some *BnFLC* copies that show expression behaviour indicative of a vernalization response, there are other copies that do not.
The assignment of regulatory modules identifies *BnFLC.C9b* as being assigned to a module unique to the gene in three of the four tissue-accession combinations.
This is a result of a very different pattern of regulation relative to other *BnFLC* copies.
A decrease in expression during the cold is only observed in the leaf tissues in both varieties, while increases in expression post-cold, to levels above pre-cold levels, are observed in all varieties and tissues.
In addition, the expression of the gene is higher in the spring variety Westar than the winter variety Tapidor.
It is therefore unlikely that *BnFLC.C9b* mediates the vernalization response in *B. napus*, and potentially has acquired a novel function in the plant.
A *BnFLC* copy unlikely to mediate the different vernalization requirements between Tapidor and Westar, despite displaying a typical vernalization response, is *BnFLC.A3a*.
This copy displays very similar pre-cold expression levels in both varieties, and exhibits cold induced expression repression that is stable upon further growth in warm conditions.
This is the case in both tissues.
Potentially this *BnFLC* copy mediates a very mild vernalization response that is not usually evident in the spring variety.
Alternatively, perhaps this copy mediates a response to a period of cold that does not influence flowering time.
One way of testing this hypothesis would be transgenic studies with *A. thaliana*, similar to a previous study[@tadege_control_2001].

There are broad similarities in the behaviour of *BnFLC* copies between tissues.
For example, a copy seems to maintain a response to vernalization and a post-cold reactivation regardless of whether it is expressed in the apex or leaf.
These between tissue similarities even extend to the between variety comparisons.
*BnFLC.A10* is expressed in Tapidor but not in Westar in both tissues, and *BnFLC.A2* is highly expressed pre-cold in Tapidor relative to Westar in both tissues.
This is reflected in the regulatory module assignments, where in all conditions the largest regulatory module corresponds to *BnFLC* copies that decrease in expression during the cold period.
However, there are a number of differences between the leaf and apex that potentially point towards some level of tissue specific divergence between the copies.
Although the expression levels cannot be compared directly between the apex and leaf due to the normalization procedure employed (Section \ref{section:spring:alignreadexplevel}), ranking the copies based on their maximal expression value leads to different rankings.
The genes that change most in their ranking in Tapidor are *BnFLC.A10* and *BnFLC.C9b*, that have a higher rank in the leaf and apex respectively.
Such changes in expression rank between the genes are not observed in Westar, potentially indicating that tissue specific changes to the regulation of *BnFLC* genes are not present in the spring variety.
Aside from these expression rank changes, tissue specific differences in *BnFLC.C2* result in the gene sharing regulatory modules with different copies.
The slight reactivation in the Tapidor leaf is not sufficient to result in the gene being assigned to a different regulatory module than other genes that decrease in expression during the cold, such as *BnFLC.A3a*.
However, the more severe reactivation in Tapidor apex does result in *BnFLC.C2* being assigned to a different regulatory module than *BnFLC.A3a*.
Interestingly the opposite is true in Westar, with *BnFLC.C2* lacking expression reactivation in the apex and possessing it in the leaf, leading to the gene not being grouped with *BnFLC.A3a*.
Although there are additional differences between copies, these copies are generally lowly expressed relative to other the *BnFLC* copies discussed above, and therefore the expression differences observed are likely to be caused by noise in the data.

The reactivation of expression following vernalization is a behaviour observed for *FLC* in some *A. thaliana* accessions[@shindo_variation_2006; @coustham_quantitative_2012].
Indeed, in perennial species of *Arabidopsis* the expression of *FLC* increases after the floral transition in order to resensitize the plant to vernalization[@satake_forecasting_2013].
The observation of expression reactivation in some of the copies of *BnFLC* raises the question of whether the behaviour of these genes reflects an ancestral perennial nature, or whether the reactivation corresponds to the particular *BnFLC* locus requiring a longer period of cold in order to become stably repressed.
Having multiple *FLC* genes responding to different lengths of vernalization has the potential to allow the plant to respond to different lengths of winter.

How does this fit into the expression traces for FT in the leaf and FD and SOC1 in the apex?

How does this relate to vernalization QTL studies

Interestingly, a copy of *FLC* on A3 was found to affect flowering time in a resynthesised *B. napus* line generated from spring *B. rapa* and *B. oleracea* varieties[@pires_flowering_2004].
However, in this case the replacement of the C3 copy FLC with an additional A3 copy resulted in an earlier flowering time.

## retention

kafri 2005
Found that highly dispensible genes tended to have paralogues with similar function.
high correlation between the essentiality of genes and the similarity of molecular function between themselves and their paralogs

Calculated correlation coefficients for pairs across 40 different experiments. As the mean of these correlations in increases (the genes become more correlated) the proportion of dispensible genes decreases.
The standard deviation of these correlations is a measure of how consistently the paralogues are correlated, or not. As this increases, dispensibility increases, suggesting that dispensible genes show greater variation in whether they're correlated or not.
Among remote paralogs, we found that the essentiality of coexpressed
pairs was very high, implying that there is little backup activity among
them. In remote pairs, backup was most efficient among transcrip-
tionally noncorrelated pairs, as their essentiality was substantially
lower than that of single genes.
Expression similarity increases for pairs with protein-protein interactions.
With close pairs, dispensability increased somewhat with expression similarity.
Optimal backup is obtained when two paralogs share some, but not all, motifs.
The more essential of the two genes tended to have more motifs.
Backup increases with coexpression, as those genes have not yet evolved reprogramming.

When mutation rates are unequal, and the functions of the genes identical, then the copy with the higher mutation rate will be lost due to selection.

## deleted from spring genes FT

Grafting experiments in a number of plant species lead to the conclusion that a floral inducer, referred to as florigen, was transported from leaves to the shoot apex to initiate flowering[@aksenova_florigen_2006; @lang_promotion_1977].
These experiments revealed that plants grown in photoperiods conducive to flowering were able to promote the flowering of plants not induced to flower by day length when grafted to them.
In these initial studies florigen was thought to be a plant hormone produced in the leaves when the plant experienced day lengths that promoted flowering, with the hormone moving to the growing shoot meristem to promote the formation of an influorescence, rather than a vegetative, meristem.
*FT* was identified as a null mutant that caused a delay in flowering when *Arabidopsis thaliana* plants were grown in long days, with a moderate delay observed when mutant plants were grown in short days [@koornneef_genetic_1991].
A *Arabidopsis thaliana* line that expressed *FT* under the control of a highly active viral promoter flowered earlier than wild type regardless of the day length the plants had been grown in, with the *FT* overexpressing plants also having terminal flowers[@kardailsky_activation_1999; @kobayashi_pair_1999].
It is likely that the transport of *FT* through the phloem is also conserved in *Brassica napus*, as *FT* like proteins were found in a proteomic analysis of sap from a spring oilseed rape[@giavalisco_towards_2006].
![**Expression traces for the *BnPIF4* genes in the leaf.** The expression values in FPKM and the 95\ % confidence intervals of those expression values as computed by Cufflinks are displayed. The two most highly expressed copies on A3 and C3 exhibit a transient increase during the cold, with expression quickly returning to pre-cold levels. This expression is not consistent with the decrease in expression observed for *BnFT* genes in the leaf.](figuredirectory/24_exp_pif4_leaf.pdf){#figure:224:pif4leaf}
The ambient temperature control of *FT* expression is via the transcription factor, with constitutive expression of *PIF4* resulting in the upregulation of *FT* in *Arabidopsis thaliana*[@kumar_transcription_2012].
In the *B.\ napus* expression data there are four expressed copies of *PIF4* (Figure \ref{figure:224:pif4leaf}).
If the expression patterns of *FT* were to be explained by their response to ambient temperature changes, you would expect the expression of some of the *PIF4* genes to drop during the cold to explain the drop in *FT* expression levels.
That this is not observed in the copies of *PIF4* expressed in *B.\ napus* suggests that the ambient temperature response is not having an effect on the expression of *FT* during the developmental transcriptome.
In the vernalization response in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *FLC* represses the expression of *FT* by binding to a site within the first promoter of *FT*[@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006].

### potentially move back to intro

The presence of multiple gene homologues in the genome complicates efforts to translate knowledge from Arabidopsis to *B. napus*.
This is due to a lack of knowledge regarding the unique function, if any, of each homologue.
Genes that are present as multiple copies following gene multiplication events can either retain the same function as the ancestral gene, partition the ancestral gene's function among the different copies, or acquire novel functions[@lynch_evolutionary_2000].
Alternatively, the genes may be lost as a consequence of genomic rearrangements, such as those that occur after genome multiplication events[TODO].

Given the amount of gene loss in *B. napus* the question arises: why have some copies been retained while others have been lost?
Initial discussions about the methods of gene retention following gene multiplication focused on the aquisition of novel, evolutionarily advantageous, functions to drive gene retention[@ohno_creation_1970].
However, as deleterious mutations occur more frequently than beneficial mutations[@lynch_genetics_1998], this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain gene retention.
A refinement of this thinking was the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DCC) hypothesis[@force_preservation_1999].
The DCC hypothesis posits that multiple copies of genes are maintained through a partitioning of the ancestral gene's functions.
In this hypothesis, different functions (such as expression domains) are determined by the regulatory elements that control expression of the gene.
Deleterious mutations in the regulatory elements of one gene alter the expression of that gene, with the deleterious phenotype of that mutation complemented by the other gene lacking the mutation.
Over evolutionary time regulatory elements continue to accumulate deleterious mutations, with the multiple copies of genes complimenting each other.
In Arabidopsis, 85% of regulatory genes sharing an ancestral gene were found to exhibit expression divergence in agreement with the DCC hypothesis[@duarte_expression_2006].
Using DNase I regulatory footprints to identify regulatory elements upstream of genes, Arsovski et al. (2015) found that the vast majority of paralogous gene pairs were either partly or fully divergence in the regulatory elements they possessed[@arsovski_evolution_2015].
Cis-regulatory element changes are therefore thought to be one of the most important driving factors for the evolution of novel gene functions.
This question has been investigated in a number of species[TODO].
The gene balance hypothesis has been proposed to answer this question, which posits that dosage effects play a role.
Dosage effects may result if the gene product acts as part of a protein complex, where an incorrect stoichiometry of proteins can result in deleterious phenotypes[TODO].
Whether these dosage effects act to retain genes in the genome, or provide selective pressure for their loss, is dependent on the type of multiplication event.
Whole genome multiplication events will maintain the stoichiometry of the proteins, with selection acting to retain the multiplied copies[TODO].
Small scale multiplication events, however, are likely to result in the stoichiometry of the proteins changing, leading to the additional copies of genes being selectively lost from the genome[TODO].
The gene balance hypothesis is consistent with observations from a number of species[TODO], and with simulations of gene duplications[TODO].
Studying the regulation of genes present as multiple copies can therefore provide clues for understanding their retention in the genome.

The framework of responsive backup circuits proposes that duplicated genes may be retained in the genome as a backup if the original copy becomes non-functional due to mutation[@kafri_transcription_2005; @kafri_regulatory_2006].
Although it may seem difficult for the evolutionary process to select for such mechanisms, given that the deleterious mutation is effectively masked from the effects of natural selection, in certain situations such a mechanism can be maintained in the genome[@nowak_evolution_1997].
These mechanisms are also predicted to increase the robustness of a regulatory system, which is potentially another method by which evolution can act to maintain duplicates[@kafri_regulatory_2006].
In a now classic model for the evolution of novel gene functions by gene duplication, Ohno proposed that relaxed selection pressure on duplicated genes either lead to novel functions, or to gene loss[@ohno_evolution_1970].
However, given that deleterious mutations occur more frequently than beneficial mutations[@lynch_genetics_1998], this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the extent of gene retention after duplication[@force_preservation_1999].
The DDC hypothesis (section \ref{section:spring:genomedivergence}) is an attractive model as it does not rely on advantageous mutations to occur.
Instead, mutations cause progressive loss of of function to duplicated genes until the ancestral functions are partitioned between the genes.
Another possibility for the retention of is escape from adaptive conflict (EAC).
Here, a single copy gene acquires a novel function that is detrimental to its original function.
When duplicated, adaptive mutation can occur to allow these separate functions to be optimized[@des_marais_escape_2008].
For example, an enzyme could acquire a mutation that allows it to catalyse a new reaction, at the expense of making it less efficient at its original function, but when duplicated each copy can become specialized to a particular reaction.

Qian and Zhang showed that duplication can lead to apaptive changes, consistent with the adaptive conflict hypothesis

Whole genome duplications have been an important part of angiosperm development[@soltis_polyploidy_2009].
Adaptive radiations, speciation, the efficacy of invasive species[@te_beest_more_2012], and domestication are all influenced by polyploidy[@dubcovsky_genome_2007].

The epigraph at the beginning of this thesis is a quote from Sir Winston Churchill.
Churchill wrote this quote to encourage the reader to interpret observations in the context of the wider perspective.
For me, this quote perfectly summarizes the field of systems biology, where large, multifaceted datasets are distilled into a handful of key insights.
There are a number of instances where this has been the case when analysing the transcriptomic time series.
The different expression patterns of floral integrator homologues, when viewed in the context of the expression of other genes and of the transcriptome as a whole, allow for understanding and generate hypotheses.
The combinatorial explosion of regulatory possibilities that results from multiple gene copies being present leads to the "intense simplicity" of many of these genes potentially being redundant.
Sequence differences that in isolation may not be of significance can be more accurately assessed for their function in light of expression data.

Duplicated gene pairs exhibited extensive divergence in the DNase I footprints surrounding the genes, suggesting that regulatory elements controlling the expression of the duplicated genes have diverged[@arsovski_evolution_2015].

This decision network has been extensively studied in a number of species, and has been modelled in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*.
The modelling considered a five gene network of *AP1*, *FT*, *TFL1*, *LFY*, and *FD*, with the interlocking feedback loops defined by these genes resulting in behaviours desirable of a decision network underlying flowering.
Namely, these behaviours were irreversability and noise filtering properties.
Mutants in the above set of five genes were used to parametrize the model, based on the number of rosette and cauline leaves the plants produced.
Instead of modelling the actions of the individual genes, however, the model abstracted the regulatory network underlying the floral transition into regulatory hubs.
These regulatory hubs represented the activity of groups of genes and proteins that were abstracted into hubs for the modelling to simplify the system and to capture the key dynamics of the system[@jaeger_interlocking_2013].
Although the regulatory hubs in the *Arabidopsis thaliana* model represented groups of genes and proteins, the model was nonetheless parametrized based on the flowering behaviour of mutants in those genes listed.
This, alongside previous results on the importance of those genes in integrating the signals that promote flowering in *Arabidopsis thaliana* justified understanding the behaviour of the copies of those genes in *Brassica napus*.
This will allow us to investigate the extent of regulatory divergence within the flowering time genes that make up this important regulatory decision network.

Dimerization as a mechanism of control within protein mediated signalling pathways has been discussed and reported for many years.
In the case of DNA binding proteins, dimerization may have a number of effects.
Monomers can have different DNA binding preferences, such that a heterodimer of two different monomers would bind to a different DNA recognition sequence than either homodimer.
The production of non-functional transcription factor monomers, such as monomers without DNA-binding domains, may sequester functional monomers and alter the expression of the targets of the transcription factor.
Finally, monomers may alter the composition of the protein complex recruited to the DNA through variation in protein-protein interaction domains.
