### AP1

Early acting genes that determine the identity of the floral meristem and late acting genes that determine floral organ identity. AP1 required for the tranition of an infloresence meristem into a floral meristem.
Cloned the genes and showed that it encodes a MADS-box containing protein. Uniformly expressed in yound flower primordia and later becomes localised to sepals and petals. The development of secondary flowers can be interpreted as a partial conversaion of a floral meristem into an inflorescence meristem. No hybridizing RNA was detected in roots, stems, or leaves. Earliest expression of AP1 is in young flower primordia and increases as the flower primordia increase in size. AP1 uniformly expressed throughout the floral meristem but not in the infloresencece meristem. At later stages of development AP1 is confined to sepals and petals. From mutant studies, AG is a negative regulator and AP2 is a positive regulator. In lfy mutant there is a partial transformation of late arising flowers into inflorescence meristems, which is enhanced in a lfy ap1 double mutant. AP1 is an A class gene. [@alejandra_mandel_molecular_1992]

TFL1 represses AP1 in the inflorescence meristem. AG represses AP1 in the two inner whorls of WT flowers. AP1 RNA accumulation in the inner two whorls of WT flowers is negatively regulated by AG. TFL1, a gene involved in the maintenance of inflorescence meristem identity, negatively regulates AP1 RNA accumulation in the inflorescence meristem. AG negatively regulates AP1, preventing its expression in the inner two whorls. Found that AP2 is not a regulator, and that the loss of AP1 expression in the ap2 mutant is due to the ectopic expression of AG. AP1 is not necessary for the regulation of AG. Ectopic expression of AP1 and LFY are in part responsible for the conversion of inflorescence meristems into floral meristems. [@gustafson_brown_regulation_1994].

AP1 seems to repress FUL - likely not directly. FUL expressed in infloresence apical meristem and not expressed in flower primordia. FUL is expressed in carpels. [@mandel_arabidopsis_1995]

AP1 overexpression causes a transformation of apical and lateral shoots into flowers, with the plants flowering much earlier. AP1 overexpressed in lfy mutant also shows this conversion, although the flowers produced have the lfy mutant phenotype of sepaloid and carpelloid structures. AP1 is downstream of LFY [@mandel_gene_1995]

CO can act to promote flowering at any stage in plant development. Expression of CO from a constitutive promoter was sufficient to overcome the delay in flowering caused by short days. Active CO frequently terminated shoot development prematurely. AP1 was expressed more slowly in response to CO activation than in response to long days. LFY on the other hand responds at the same rate to CO or to exposure to long days. [@simon_activation_1996]

C-terminal domain of AP1 acts as a transcriptional activator. [@cho_analysis_1999].

LFY and AP1 consitutive promoters cause a reduction in the jeuvenile phase of citrus trees [@pena_constitutive_2001].

AGL24 and SVP only present during early flower development (stages 1 and 2). AP1 directly binds to B, C, and E MADS box floral organ identity genes. AP1-SVP AP1-AGL24 dimers Chip [@gregis_arabidopsis_2009].

AP1 acts upstream of the cytokinin biosynthesis and degradation pathways to suppress meristem activity in the sepal axils. [@han_cytokinin_2014]

Activated AP1 protein and looked at differential expression, and also performed AP1 Chip-Seq. 25% of AP1 targets are TFs. AP1 represses TFL1 and binds to at least two sites in the 3' region. More than 80% of AP1 targets were down-regulated. AP1 appears to establish floral meristem identity by repressing genes that are part of the shoot developmental program. [@kaufmann_orchestration_2010].

### FT

Graft experiments suggested the presence of a florigen, a flower inducing hormone that promotes flowering under inductive photoperiods [@lang_promotion_1977]

FT mutant shows delayed flowering in long days and moderatly delayed flowering in short days [@koornneef_genetic_1991].

Used activation tagging; T-DNA insertion of a viral promoter randomly in the genome. Found a mutant that flowered early regardless of day length and had terminal flowers. FT overexpresser causes AP1 expression in flower primordia. Also accelerates flowering regardless of day length and the status (over or underexpressed) TFL1. Long days in Col, FT expression in cotyledons, apex, hypocotyl but nothing in root. In both long and short days, FT levels in WT increased from young seedlings to older plants, with higher overall levels in long days. Changing CO activity has no effect in a FT overexpression background. FT overexpression caused induction of LFY.  [@kardailsky_activation_1999]

FT gradually increased in with time under both LD and SD photoperiods, although upregulation was delayed and reduced under SD conditions. In the CO mutant, upregulation of FT expression was delayed. Activation of inducible CO causes upregulation of FT, indicating regulation. As upregulation of FT occurs eventually in co mutants and in SD photoperiods there is likely a photoperiod independent pathway. Early flowering of FT overexpressers was correlated with FT mRNA levels. LFY and FT overexpressers produced a terminal flower as soon as the plant germinated. [@kobayashi_pair_1999]

Found a single amino acid residue change conferred TFL1 activity to FT and vica versa. [@hanzawa_single_2005]

FT-dependent accumulation of FUL and SEP3. Full FT action in the leaf is dependent on FD. FT overexpressor flower early. Found a response to ambient temperature changes with the FT overexpresser line. Temperature affected the ability of FT to affect the expression of SEP3. SEP3 necessary for the leaf curling phenotype observed. [@teper_bamnolker_flowering_2005]

FT is the major output of CO activity, and FT acts upstream of SOC1[@yoo_constans_2005]

FLC binds to the SOC1 promoter and to the first intron of FT, consistent with FLC based repression of these genes. FLC proteins are able to form homodimers. [@helliwell_arabidopsis_2006]

In SD grown plants, FT mRNA is low, whereas FT expression was increased in each long day. The expression of FT returned to low levels after return to short days. Inducible CO protein; induction lead to FT increase, with the increase not being seen in untreated leaves. In situ hybridisation experiments and GFP fusions suggested that the FT protein moves from the phloem companion cells to the meristem, as no FT mRNA was detected in the apex. Graft experiments also suggest the FT protein moves. FT protein expressed in the minor veins so to keep it in the leaf is not able to accelerate flowering, suggesting that the hypothesis of FT activating a secondary messanger is wrong. [@corbesier_ft_2007]

FT protein is what moves to the apex. FT with a nuclear localization peptide addition was not able to rescue ft mutants when expressed in the vasculature, but was able to rescue the phenotype when expressed in the apex [@jaeger_ft_2007].

Silenced FT just in phloem companion cells and still found the same effect on flowering as if it was silenced all over the plant.[@mathieu_export_2007]

FT protein is transported from donor to apical region of the recipient within a short period of 24-28 hours. [@notaguchi_long_distance_2008]

FT protein expressed in the leaf is transported to the axillary bud and promotes the floral transition of the axillary meristem. BRC1 inhibits this function of FT. [@niwa_branched1_2013]

FT is an early target of CO. ft mutant delayed the early flowering phenotype of a CO overexpressor, but only partially suppressed the phenotype. [@samach_distinct_2000]

### SOC1

Identified as a gene which was differentially expressed after CO protein activation. Overexpression of SOC1 from 35S promoter caused early flowering under both long and short days. SOC1 not detected in shoot apex of SD grown plants, but present in SAM and leaf primordia of plants in continuous light. Expressed in inflorescence meristem but excluded from young floral primordia. Regulated by autonomous pathway. Shown to have an age response in co and fca mutant background. [@samach_distinct_2000]

### CO

CO::GUS expression detected in the vascular tissue of the hypocotyl, the cotyledons and the leaves. Expression also detected at the apex and in the cells of young leaves, restricted to vascular tissue in older leaves. CO expression in the phloem is sufficient to trigger flowering and that expression in the leaf and meristem was not required. ft mutation delayed flowering of phloem expressed CO, but was not as delayed as a ft mutation. CO is vasculature expressed; doesn't move to leaf or meristem. [@an_constans_2004]
